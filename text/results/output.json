I'd be happy to do any of them! Let me know if it's be easier to read through them as separate issues and I can separate them.\r\n\r\n## Talk #1: Reviving the Dream of the 90s with WebGL\r\n\r\nIf you’re like me, you’ve spent hours staring at Windows 98 screensavers when you were growing up. Sadly, screensavers are no more, but we’ve got the power to fix that. In this talk, I’ll walk you through how to harness modern technology to revive the dream of the 90s. Using A-Frame and other modern web technologies, I’ll show you how to recreate some iconic imagery, including 3D Pipes, The Maze, and The Matrix screensavers.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://billyroh.com/screensavers/\r\n\r\n## Talk #2: Learning through Art: An Introduction to VR\r\n\r\nVirtual reality can be daunting—it’s unclear what you can do with it and it’s hard to know where to even start. I’ll introduce you to fundamental VR concepts by re-creating an interactive installation art piece by Yayoi Kusama in A-Frame, a VR web framework. So you can try it out at home, I’ll also walk you through the ecosystem of VR libraries and affordable hardware that’s currently out there.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://billyroh.com/obliteration/\r\n\r\n## Talk #3: Albers as a Millennial\r\n\r\nWhat kind of art would Josef and Anni Albers have made if they were millennials? Come learn about how to make generative interactive art with the magic of JavaScript. The audience will learn about applying colour theory with HSL, composing and generating your own patterns with SVG, and creating a sense of depth with motion and interaction.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://billyroh.com/albers/\r\n\r\n## About me\r\n\r\n**Name**: Billy Roh\r\n\r\n**Pronouns**: he/him\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: @billyroh\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):** https://billyroh.com/\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** November, December, January\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/599","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/599/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/599/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/599/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/599","id":512020019,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTIwMjAwMTk=","number":599,"title":"Program Quantum Computers in JavaScript!","user":{"login":"mapmeld","id":643918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzkxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/643918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld","html_url":"https://github.com/mapmeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":544673594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzM1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/december","name":"december","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":736743566,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzY3NDM1NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/january","name":"january","color":"90f9f2","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2019-10-24T15:28:07Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T15:41:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\nProgram Quantum Computers in JavaScript!\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nIn a few labs around the world, the next generation of computers are being built out of \"qubits\".

I'll go into detail about how I combined the concepts of meta-programming and reactive-programming to make transforming code into a visualization possible, as well as some of the major challenges I faced when writing the JS that does that.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Omar Jameer\r\n\r\n**Pronouns**: He/Him\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\ndeployed link: https://www.algoviz.io/\r\nrepo: https://github.com/omarjuice/algo-viz\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** september, october\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/588","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/588/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/588/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/588/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/588","id":487131442,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODcxMzE0NDI=","number":588,"title":"Map from First Principles: Adventures in Functional Programming, talk submission","user":{"login":"thoughtbyte","id":6225496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjU0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6225496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte","html_url":"https://github.com/thoughtbyte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbyte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":544673558,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzM1NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/november","name":"november","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-08-29T19:16:38Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T18:59:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** Map from First Principles: Adventures in Functional Programming\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:** The best way to learn about and truly understand some of the built in JavaScript methods is to rewrite them.

While it's impractical, rewriting map with recursion will let us explore some of the foundations of functional programming. We'll end with a brief discussion of the lambda calculus, and whether or not we can rewrite `map`, in principle, with nothing but anonymous functions.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Vincent Abruzzo\r\n\r\n**Pronouns**: he/him\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** September, October, November\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/587","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/587/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/587/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/587/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/587","id":486537458,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODY1Mzc0NTg=","number":587,"title":"babel-fish","user":{"login":"caiogondim","id":33044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/33044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim","html_url":"https://github.com/caiogondim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiogondim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":544673429,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzM0Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/september","name":"september","color":"bc8c3e","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-08-28T18:21:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T22:31:17Z","closed_at":"2019-09-05T22:31:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\nbabel-fish: on-the-fly JS transpiler/optimizer.\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nbabel-fish is an on-the-fly optimized JavaScript transpiler. It acts as a reverse proxy for JavaScript resources and uses information about the requesting browser to optimize transpilation and polyfill addition to make full use of native browser features that are available in the requesting agent. This results in smaller, more performant bundles for newer browsers.\r\n\r\nIt applies 3 main optimizations techniques:\r\n\r\n- dynamic transpilation: minimum transpilation possible on the request file for the requesting browser\r\n- dynamic polyfill: only polyfill what's needed for the requested file to run on the requesting browser\r\n- dynamic compression: uses the best compression algorithm (gzip, deflate or brotli) supported by the requesting browser\r\n\r\nbabel-fish was originally created to be used with VHS3 (NYT media player).

Many people are familiar with S3 cloud storage, but AWS offers a lot of software and services that power things like Slack, Alexa, messenger bots, etc.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same process of building 1-800-NYTIMES customer service phone line, I will go over how I built an IVR where you call a number and have to complete the lyrics to Drake's Hotline Bling song to continue to the next prompt in the call flow.

If you are building a product that offers content, and your users need to find specific content, then you need to build a search engine.\r\n\r\nBut building an effective search engine that meets your users’ needs is not easy. When we search for something, we have expectations that the engine will help us find things that we want easily or help us stumble upon things that we like and didn’t know existed. \r\n\r\nI want to change the narrative of content discovery. I will enumerate problems search engines solve - and don’t solve - based on your content and users. I will discuss my personal experiences with search engines being abused as databases and used in contexts where curation would have yielded better results for users with lower engineering costs. You will learn how to develop product hypotheses when you don’t have insights into your users just yet.\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nHannah Mimi\r\n\r\n**Pronouns**:\r\nshe/her\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\n@hannahmimipark\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** We recommend selecting multiple months (up to 3) that you are available to speak.

We identify the most reusable and composable aspects of our tools. We'll look at code that stands the test of time and give you tips to write some too.\r\n\r\nThe Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well and are composable has left a lasting mark on computer science. Most of us use the command line every day. We try to write code that is modular, reusable, and simple. We understand that simple does not equal easy. We know that foundational components of the machines we use every day were written decades ago.\r\n\r\nAnd yet: web development in the last fifteen years or so may feel to some like a possessed carousel spinning so fast that before you get familiar with one JS framework, it's getting thrown off the side in favor of the next.\r\n\r\nI'll argue understanding essential JS, your code in general, and some of its strongest and most useful components will also help you create small and light pieces that compose and customize to your needs. Understanding a bit of the history of the command line tools we use every day will cement the understanding of how valuable these tenets are, and will give you a stronger appreciation of the gurus from the days of punchcards and room-sized mainframes that held less data than your watch.

We will constantly be living between feeling like we know nothing and feeling like we know everything there is to know. However, every so often we will come across tools that we have been able to master. Along with a feeling of accomplishment, we may want to share that knowledge with others. This talk will explain the science around learning, tools for getting the most out of our learning, and how we can empower others to learn from and with us.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Prince Wilson\r\n\r\n**Pronouns**: He/Him\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: @maxcell\r\n\r\n~**Website (optional):**~\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** May"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/557","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/557/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/557/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/557/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/557","id":436936095,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzY5MzYwOTU=","number":557,"title":"The Future of Open Source","user":{"login":"ehashman","id":4706131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDYxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4706131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman","html_url":"https://github.com/ehashman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":805534149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDU1MzQxNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/may","name":"may","color":"d0f796","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-04-24T22:35:31Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T18:25:57Z","closed_at":"2019-05-06T18:25:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** The Future of Open Source\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:** Just 20 years ago, the term \"open source\" didn't even exist. The majority of industry software was sold in binary form, and the idea of building a business by giving away source code for free was inconceivable when the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, had built his business, Microsoft, on selling proprietary software. But 20 years later, \"[open][1] [source][2] [has][3] [won][4]\": the majority of the tech industry runs on open source software, and even Microsoft has joined the movement, [acquiring][5] and contributing to the largest open source development platform in the world!\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.wired.com/2016/08/open-source-won-now/\r\n[2]: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3144063/open-source-has-won-and-microsoft-has-surrendered.html\r\n[3]: https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-and-open-source-have-won-get-over-it/\r\n[4]: https://osjournal.com/open-source-has-won-now-it-needs-to-remain-vigilant-299/\r\n[5]: https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/\r\n\r\nBut if open source has won, do we still need an open source movement?

In this talk, I'll ponder some of these questions, and propose a vision for the future of the open source software community.\r\n\r\nNote: I am a Director on the Open Source Initiative's Board.

This project looks to invert that relationship by using audio to create virtual 3D environments. Using VR these environments can be experienced as if one was inhabiting the environment.\r\nThe process of going from audio signals to a 3D environment involves deconstructing the audio into numbers which can be used as an input into parametric algorithms for creating 3D forms. Often the inspiration for such designs has been to express a relationship between an environment and other abstract concepts, supported by engineering and design to make the environments habitable and functional.\r\nThe ephermal medium of virtual environments remove the shackles of real world and allow for more experimental habitats and enjoyable experiences. The demo application explores a few such concepts by exposing parametric relationships established in architectural design but augmenting them to react to music in real time creating a dynamic music driven world.\r\nDemo: [http://lotusaudio.herokuapp.com/](http://lotusaudio.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nAmit Nambiar\r\n\r\n**Pronouns**:\r\nHe/Him\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\n[https://amitnambiar.com](https://amitnambiar.com)\r\n[http://lotusaudio.herokuapp.com/](http://lotusaudio.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** We recommend selecting multiple months (up to 3) that you are available to speak.

Instead of manually specifying input and output cases, the developer specifies laws (aka properties) that should hold for _all_ expected input types. The system then **generates** many random inputs, **verifies** if the property holds in all cases, and **simplifies** failing inputs to find error boundaries.

Moving beyond easy to catch nits around as formatting nits and variable naming, we will take a rigorous look to understand how the code can be improved on a deeper level.  We will analyze the tests to ensure that they are sufficient while looking for ways to improve their quality, look for opportunities to refactor, and scan for edge cases and logical errors.

It’s practically impossible to stay up to date on every single new feature, and it seems like there’s a new hot framework or library every few months, _e.g._ TypeScript, MobX, Next.js, Prisma, Hooks, Suspense, etc. This talk’s thesis is that you don’t actually have to stay up to date. On the other hand, the goal isn’t to become front-end ostriches, _i.e._ bury our heads in the sand and ignore every new feature. Rather, we can try to cultivate a balanced approach to continuously learning about the ecosystem, and thoughtfully adopting specific features.\r\n\r\nI'll share the system I’ve developed to determine what’s worth learning at a surface level, and what is worth learning deeply; resources to actually learn a topic; and how to play catch up when needed. I’ll also talk briefly about strategies for adopting newer features in production codebases at work.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Saimon Sharif\r\n\r\n**Preferred Pronouns**: He / Him\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: saimonsharif\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** December 2018, January 2019, February 2019"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/527","id":381994800,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODE5OTQ4MDA=","number":527,"title":"(Request to Cancel for BrooklynJS) Building a Real-Time, Collaborative REPL","user":{"login":"YingCGooi","id":25574844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTc0ODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25574844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi","html_url":"https://github.com/YingCGooi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YingCGooi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":544673594,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzM1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/december","name":"december","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":772693680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzI2OTM2ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/february","name":"february","color":"45c6be","default":false},{"id":736743566,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzY3NDM1NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/january","name":"january","color":"90f9f2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-11-18T20:04:47Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T17:45:51Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T17:45:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** Building SpaceCraft: A Real-Time, Collaborative REPL\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**  SpaceCraft is an open-source, real-time, collaborative REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) that allows users to write and execute code in the browser.

code and way more.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about the power of naming conventions, the delightful wonder that are config files and my journey from barely knowing how to write a console.log() to kinda

process of building an electron app that simulates a cracked screen.

The end result will be open source on GitHub. \r\n\r\n(PS if accepted, this is my first time I have spoken at any BoroJS meetup in NYC, and fun fact, also the first tech talk I've given outside of a _cough_ my little pony convention this year!

JavaScript libraries that seem like they might help you implement complex animations can end up revealing limitations in real-world situations.\r\n\r\nI'll focus on two React libraries that I think do a good job of lowering the barrier to entry by simplifying the process of creating advanced transitions: [React-Pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/) and my own project [React-Flip-Toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit). While my focus will be on React, the challenges posed and solutions discussed should be somewhat relevant irrespective of framework.\r\n\r\nThe final part of my talk will walk through implementing a practical example using `React-Flip-Toolkit`, probably using a condensed version of [this presentation](https://alex.holachek.com/rft-tutorial).\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nAlex Holachek\r\n\r\n**Website

CSS rules and event handlers are particularly notorious for this; every developer has horror stories of some seemingly innocuous stylesheet changes breaking their site, or impossibly tangled event handler spaghetti. Many of the \"trendiest\" libraries promise to solve these specific problems for us (e.g. CSS-in-JS, Redux, MobX). This is no coincidence, as CSS and event handlers fundamentally share the same problem: they create many-to-many indirect relationships between otherwise unconnected components. Likewise, the solutions share similar properties -- they make the implicit relationships explicit, and prevent common causes of conflict.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a literal horror story: a tale of \"refactoring\" a haunted house filled with spirits who behave like JavaScript event handlers, and the mayhem that ensues when their order is disturbed. I discover the \"spells\" that have conjured these ghosts, and realize that they are not malevolent, per se; much like some CSS rules and event handlers, they just respond poorly to changes in their environment. In the process of taming these ghosts, I discuss the theory of indirection and its problems outlined above, and how I can uses the principles espoused by trendy javascript libraries to live in harmony with my spectral companions.\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nJustin Falcone\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\nmodernserf\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\nhttps://justinfalcone.com/\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** \r\n**Ideally** October, since this is a \"spooky\" talk, but also November, December\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/508","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/508/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/508/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/508/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/508","id":360058647,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjE1NDA5OTI1","number":508,"title":"Fix link to EmpireJS","user":{"login":"restlessbit","id":6979137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6979137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit","html_url":"https://github.com/restlessbit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restlessbit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-09-13T20:41:44Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T20:52:49Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T20:52:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/508","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/508","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/508.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/508.patch"},"body":"Hello, \r\n\r\nI noticed the link to the EmpireJS website was broken;

Of course, this means that when applications lose their connection, they lose almost all functionality and user experience.\r\n\r\n\"Offline-first\" or \"offline-ready\" is a paradigm that seeks to maintain functionality for applications, even when clients are offline for extended periods.\r\n\r\nThe primary challenge is storing data on clients, particularly for applications that feature lots of data and collaboration between users. Data changes have to be synchronized between clients and a remote server, and conflicts have to be resolved.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this talk will cover:\r\n- In-browser options for persistent data storage\r\n- Writing a Promise-based wrapper to work with the asynchronous IndexedDB API\r\n- Tracking JSON document changes in a tree data structure\r\n- Synchronizing database changes to a MongoDB backend over HTTP\r\n- How to handle conflicting changes between users\r\n- Using existing libraries to make your applications offline-first\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, I will draw on my experience working on [turtleDB](https://turtle-db.github.io/), an offline-first framework written in JS, to discuss these challenges.\r\n\r\nI have a slide presentation ready and can email on request.\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nAndrew Houston-Floyd\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-houston-floyd/\r\nhttps://turtle-db.github.io/ (project website)\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** \r\nSeptember, October, November\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/504","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/504/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/504/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/504/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/504","id":353098092,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTMwOTgwOTI=","number":504,"title":"Post-Hardcore JavaScript","user":{"login":"mathisonian","id":1074773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1074773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian","html_url":"https://github.com/mathisonian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathisonian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-08-22T19:48:12Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T17:26:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-02T17:26:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\nPost-Hardcore JavaScript\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nIn this talk I walk through how I made this interactive article, [The D-I-Y Data of Fugazi](https://mathisonian.github.io/diy-data-fugazi/).

While this is actual literal magic, it leaves a lot unexplained, and this mystery left me hesitant to try WebAssembly until I figured out what the magic compilers were doing and why.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about the boundary region between a blob of WebAssembly bytecode and the Javascript environment that calls it. Specifically:\r\n* a quick summary of WABT, the [web assembly binary toolkit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)\r\n* how WebAssembly exports functions for Javascript to call\r\n* how WebAssembly imports and calls foreign functions\r\n* what data WebAssembly can and can't represent\r\n* what data can be shared across WebAssembly and Javascript environments\r\n* how to represent complex structs in allocated memory\r\n* how to deal with strings\r\n* an example that wraps all of that ^^ together\r\n\r\nIn other words, I'm going to talk about all the glue code that a programmer needs to implement for WebAssembly to be conveniently usable, which should help explain what the magic bundlers are doing behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Jesse Kipp\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: @toomanybees\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):** toomanybees.com\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** September, November, December\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/502","id":348106806,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDgxMDY4MDY=","number":502,"title":"Organizing Code for Cross-Platform Web and Mobile Development","user":{"login":"bscarano","id":1707804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDc4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1707804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano","html_url":"https://github.com/bscarano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bscarano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":544673106,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzMxMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/august","name":"august","color":"f9d0c4","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-08-06T22:45:56Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T20:47:31Z","closed_at":"2018-08-14T20:47:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\nOrganizing Code for Cross-Platform Web and Mobile Development\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nFor teams that deliver code for the web, android, and iOS, we want to avoid writing all of our logic three times, in three different languages, across three different platforms.

A comparison of the core principles of decentralized and centralized systems.\r\n2. An explanation of the core challenges encountered in decentralized systems related to:\r\n- Efficient peer lookup and routing\r\n- Efficiently distributing data loads\r\n- Ensuring cooperation without central authorities with incentives\r\n- How incentive-based transactions can be engineered with smart contracts\r\n- Ensuring data integrity and availability in a network of untrusted peers\r\n- And how these become more difficult when you can't trust peers to be regularly connected, non-malicious, or even in possession of powerful devices and high bandwidth.\r\n3. A walkthrough of the iterative development process of Layr, in which I describe:\r\n- How we went from an extremely simple proof of concept prototype to a sophisticated network of nodes\r\n- Why data integrity is a problem and how we solved it\r\n- Why privacy is a problem and how we solved it\r\n- Why cooperation is a problem and how we solved it\r\n- Why large files are a problem and how we

This talk will be light on JS, but heavy on way cool CSS.\r\n\r\n**Name**: \r\nTyler Gaw\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle**: \r\n[@tylergaw](https://twitter.com/tylergaw)\r\n\r\n**Website:** \r\nhttps://tylergaw.com\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** \r\nMay, June, July\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/483/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/483","id":316538628,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTY1Mzg2Mjg=","number":483,"title":"Restoring our privacy in a time of none","user":{"login":"donohoe","id":36363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/36363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe","html_url":"https://github.com/donohoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donohoe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":544672978,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzI5Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/june","name":"june","color":"FFFF33","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-04-22T00:57:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T20:53:33Z","closed_at":"2018-06-07T20:53:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** \r\nRestoring our privacy in a time of none\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nPrivacy is coming to the forefront of national conversation (again) and many non-EU sites are discovering late in the game they need to comply with the EU privacy laws like the GDPR - or block all EU traffic.

Namely, a decentralized system does not take for granted that a data host is inherently trustworthy, available, or resistant to failure.\r\n\r\nWith great interest in p2p decentralized systems such as Storj, IPFS, and Sia, a team of three developers took a month and a half to build Layr: a decentralized file storage system built atop the Kademlia DHT that enforces data retrievability and provides a cryptocurrency-based incentive.\r\n\r\nIn the course of building Layr, we encountered many technical and system-design challenges. For example, how does a decentralized system logically distribute and locate files? How does a decentralized system decouple file retrievability from failures on the part of the node hosting that file? How does a decentralized system detect and respond to data loss or corruption to maintain the file's retrievability? How do we provide incentive to encourage ethical behavior of all parties involved? How do we do all of this in a no-trust environment? In this presentation you will learn how we used techniques such as file sharding, proofs of retrievability, cryptocurrency-based transactions and contracts, and extending the Kademlia protocol to solve some of those problems.\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nWilfred Tannr Allard\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\nTannrAllard\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\nwww.tannrallard.tech\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** \r\n\r\nAll of May\r\nAll of June\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/480","id":312229999,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTIyMjk5OTk=","number":480,"title":"End to End Testing With Cypress vs. Selenium","user":{"login":"haroldtreen","id":1745854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDU4NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1745854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen","html_url":"https://github.com/haroldtreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haroldtreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":544673035,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzMwMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/july","name":"july","color":"d93f0b","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-07T18:17:00Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T04:30:28Z","closed_at":"2018-07-06T04:30:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** \r\n\r\nEnd to End Testing With Cypress vs. Selenium\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\n\r\nEver written an end-to-end test for a website? \r\nIt’s hard! \r\n\r\nThe current go-to tool for these tests is Selenium. It lets you issue commands to your browser to automate any actions a user might take - which is awesome! Unfortunately, it’s not the most robust system. Selenium tests can be extremely flakey, slow, and hard to debug. \r\n\r\nBut now there’s a new kid on the block: Cypress! It’s an open source tool that takes a different approach in hopes of making end-to-end testing faster, friendlier, and more reliable. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll dive deeper into the differences between Cypress and Selenium, such as time travel debugging, live reloading, and automatic waiting. Through this exploration, I hope to show off how fun and easy end to end testing can be! 😍\r\n\r\n**Name**: Harold Treen\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: @haroldtreen\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):** https://haroldtreen.com\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** May, June, July\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/479","id":312148565,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTIxNDg1NjU=","number":479,"title":"From \"Hello, world\" to The World's Best Crossword Maker in 8 weeks","user":{"login":"keiranking","id":28635708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjM1NzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/28635708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking","html_url":"https://github.com/keiranking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keiranking/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":805534149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDU1MzQxNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/may","name":"may","color":"d0f796","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-04-06T23:33:00Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T21:57:25Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T21:55:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Talk Title: From \"Hello, world\" to The World's Best Crossword Maker in 8 weeks\r\n\r\nTalk Description: I write crosswords for the New York Times.

Components are styled with the help of a style context, and that style context is updated using a style reducer. The result: when you move a `<Button />` into a `<Panel />`, the context it receives changes, and it knows to style itself differently. You can focus on only writing business logic - never write styles again.\r\n\r\nI'd love to share this library that I'm working on :)\r\n\r\n**Name**: Robert Balicki\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: statisticsftw\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):** https://www.chameleonjs.com/\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** All of them, in general"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/476","id":308818820,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDg4MTg4MjA=","number":476,"title":"Building Fictional Worlds in Javascript: How I built a text adventure game in React","user":{"login":"nickbytes","id":3009331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDkzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3009331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes","html_url":"https://github.com/nickbytes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickbytes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":805534149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDU1MzQxNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/may","name":"may","color":"d0f796","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-03-27T04:33:17Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T21:56:45Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T21:56:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** Building Fictional Worlds in Javascript: How I built a text adventure game in React.\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**  When I set out to build a game in JavaScript, I expected that I might learn a few new things about browser APIs.

Yet in an increasingly data-driven world, visualization practitioners frequently need to tackle this challenge. As the data scales, designers and developers must find novel methods to reduce visual complexity and optimize rendering.\r\n\r\nRecently at Datadog we were faced with the challenge of scaling our visualization of customers’ deployed infrastructure, a component of our mission-critical monitoring product. Some customers have tens of thousands of hosts reporting data, and there’s no perfect way to aggregate them in an overview. Furthermore, browser rendering technologies start to degrade when rendering tens of thousands of elements. We needed to find a solution that would scale with our customers, especially as we added support for containerized infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll recount our journey of leveraging WebGL to scale beyond what d3 and SVG could handle. The talk will be partly technical and partly design-oriented, with enough real-world lessons learned to engage any audience member. I’ll explain how to decide if WebGL rendering makes sense for your visualization, describe the pitfalls we encountered and how to overcome them, and how we ultimately found success incorporating this new and challenging technology into our large, rapidly-evolving frontend codebase.\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\n\r\nMark Hintz\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\n\r\n`@MarkHintz`\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:**\r\n\r\nMarch, April, May\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/474","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/474/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/474/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/474/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/474","id":298840029,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTg4NDAwMjk=","number":474,"title":"Developing a Language Teacher with Natural Language Processing","user":{"login":"mapmeld","id":643918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzkxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/643918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld","html_url":"https://github.com/mapmeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapmeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":805534068,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDU1MzQwNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/april","name":"april","color":"bbb3f2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-02-21T04:40:56Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T04:45:56Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T04:45:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:** Developing a Language Teacher with Natural Language Processing\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:** In November I started learning Esperanto on Duolingo.

Through a fun confluence of design and technical goals, we wanted it to be not only responsive, but modular—we would build a bunch of different widgets that could be squished together in all kinds of crazy unforeseen ways. Media queries let you restyle your content based on the width of the browser's viewport, but for our use case that was only _part_ of the problem: sometimes, a widget's \"viewport\" was just a slice of the browser's, which meant that the browser viewport–based queries didn't really help.\r\n\r\nWell, as the saying goes, when your problem isn't a nail but your only tool is a hammer, you might as well attack your problem with _a whole lot of hammers_. Viewport-based queries did totally solve our problem—we just had to have _enough_ of them. 😎\r\n\r\nOur progression was something like this:\r\n1. Despair.\r\n2. The Really Stupid Idea of just using _a bunch_ of media queries to fake \"virtual viewports\" within the browser viewport.\r\n3. A terrible Ruby script that wrote some CSS.\r\n4. The discovery that no one in their right mind would implement this as a Less mixin. (I tried. I still have nightmares.)\r\n4. The world's gnarliest Sass mixin.\r\n5. Nirvana: normal-looking source CSS, achieved through some custom PostCSS plugins, one of which provided a rule that was _conceptually_ equivalent to a normal media query but in practice compiled to, like, a bazillion of them.\r\n\r\nThe punchline is, of course, that while all this _somehow actually worked_, we ditched it in the end because the problem it set out to solve never wound up being a real problem. And so we just replaced our fancy custom rule with normal media queries, which worked Just Fine, after all.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Adam Lloyd\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: [@jugglewheels](https://twitter.com/jugglewheels) (but set your expectations low—I've barely tweeted since the good ol' 140-character days.)\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** February, April, May"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/462","id":290003953,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTAwMDM5NTM=","number":462,"title":"Talk Submission: Experiences on creating an Arabic programming language (in JavaScript)","user":{"login":"SimplyAhmazing","id":1294344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQzNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1294344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing","html_url":"https://github.com/SimplyAhmazing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimplyAhmazing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":772693680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzI2OTM2ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/february","name":"february","color":"45c6be","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-01-19T15:03:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T20:48:28Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T20:48:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\n\r\nExperiences on creating an Arabic programming language\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 2015, while at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), I started working on creating an Arabic programming language that could potentially be used by Arabic speaking people to learn programming.

In this talk we'll explore why it's implementation and prevalence in hardware makes for a uniquely intriguing and accessible platform for creative coding.\r\n\r\nTiny computers such as the [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [C.H.I.P.](https://getchip.com/) have finally reached a level of  performance and affordability that makes hardware experimentation accessible to everyone. At the same time, JavaScript has emerged as the lingua franca of web programming and can be found in many places beyond just the browser. \r\n\r\nWhat if I told you there was a mature protocol that's been around since 1983 and was uniquely poised to take advantage of this development?\r\n\r\nWell, wonder no more and [meet MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI)! \r\n\r\nSitting at convergence of these two things is MIDI — a niche protocol that's been around since 1983 and was originally designed for musical instruments to communicate with one another. It's event-oriented approach to messaging feels right at home in the asynchronous world of JavaScript & Node, and the prevalence of MIDI support in older musical equipment means you can find unique, hackable and affordable hardware at your local pawnshop or Craig's List.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely tech stack — Tiny Computers + JavaScript + MIDI — can lend itself to creative programming beyond music.

BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\nContractPatch: Employment Advocacy for the Digital Laborer\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nMany developers and tech workers sign employment agreements with their employers that include broad restrictions on their ability to contribute to FOSS projects — whether as part of their employment, after hours, or both. ContractPatch is an initiative to give digital laborers the words they need to make sure they can continue the work that’s important to them and to our community. Whether those words are negotiation tactics in the hiring process, or language to suggest for a prospective employment agreement, ContractPatch aims to help developers defend their own interests and property rights.\r\n\r\nNegotiating a contract is a skill like any other.

That's great for developer happiness but there are some significant trade-offs. Svelte changes all that by compiling your declarative components into JavaScript that resembles the targeted DOM manipulation code you'd write yourself — in other words, doing the hard work once at build time instead of *n* times at run time.\r\n\r\nThere's loads of different aspects I could focus on:\r\n\r\n* your app gets much smaller, because you no longer need to ship a virtual DOM differ/data binding system/virtual machine/whatever\r\n* your app gets much *faster*, because the compiler can aggressively optimize — no need to do complex diffing operations etc\r\n* your app is easier on the garbage collector, because you're not generating a new copy of your entire view on every state change. Svelte uses less memory than any other framework, which is great for mobile\r\n* your codebase is regret-proof — because there's no real runtime framework to speak of, you never have to worry about shipping two frameworks simultaneously if you decide to adopt a new tool in future\r\n* because components are self-contained, it completely changes the game when it comes to interoperability. Web components finally make sense!\r\n* SSR is a crazy amount faster — you just tell the compiler to output a string-generating function instead of a DOM-generating one\r\n* the developer experience is beautiful. For example you can write normal CSS and it will be encapsulated/statically analysed etc\r\n* simplicity/minimalism versus power/features is revealed to be a false dichotomy\r\n\r\n**Name**: Rich Harris\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**: [@rich_harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris)\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):** [svelte.technology](https://svelte.technology)\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** July, August, September\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/410","id":239485275,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzk0ODUyNzU=","number":410,"title":"Disrupting the Developer Experience","user":{"login":"thescientist13","id":895923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTkyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/895923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13","html_url":"https://github.com/thescientist13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thescientist13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":544673429,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzM0Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/september","name":"september","color":"bc8c3e","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-29T13:48:46Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T15:22:57Z","closed_at":"2017-10-05T15:22:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\nDisrupting the Developer Experience\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\nBuilding applications in the \"modern age\" requires acknowledgement and acceptance of paradigm shifts in many facets of a company's operations, and while resources are focused on tooling and technology, one critical component — the developer experience —  is often overlooked.

Unfortunately, it can be hard to find a simple introduction to the Hindley-Milner system. Much writing on the topic ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system), [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/399312/what-is-hindley-milner#answer-399392)) invokes academic concepts that obscure the system's essential practicality. \r\n\r\nMy talk has three parts. First, I argue that Hindley-Milner is an exceptionally efficient means of documentation by comparing the type signature for the identity function to four different plain English explanations. Then, I introduce the audience to the Hindley-Milner syntax by writing type signatures for familiar functions such as `concat`, `filter`, `map`, `partial` and `reduce`. Finally, I talk about ways in which Hindley-Miner doesn't fit JavaScript perfectly and review some of the [solutions proposed](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/Type-Signatures#ramda-miscellany) by the [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) team. \r\n\r\nI aim to leave the audience able to read Hindley-Milner type signatures and perhaps persuaded that this system provides a lightweight compliment to more comprehensive documentation systems such as JSDoc.\r\n\r\n**Name**: Max Hallinan\r\n\r\n**~~Twitter~~ Mastodon Handle (optional)**: https://oulipo.social/@maxhallinan\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):** https://github.com/maxhallinan\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** June, July 2017\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/395","id":227070876,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTE5NDY0NjE5","number":395,"title":"clarify selection timing","user":{"login":"jed","id":4433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed","html_url":"https://github.com/jed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-08T14:49:31Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T06:33:46Z","closed_at":"2017-06-14T06:33:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/395","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/395","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/395.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/395.patch"},"body":"~~~ THE MOST PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE PULL REQUEST IN BROOKLYNJS HISTORY ~~~"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/394","id":226602440,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjY2MDI0NDA=","number":394,"title":"Debugging Google-React-Maps for Beginners","user":{"login":"gee2789","id":4576371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzYzNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4576371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789","html_url":"https://github.com/gee2789","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gee2789/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":544673106,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ2NzMxMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/august","name":"august","color":"f9d0c4","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-05T15:06:58Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T12:37:53Z","closed_at":"2017-08-10T12:37:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## BrooklynJS Talk Submission\r\n\r\n**Talk Title:**\r\n Debugging Google-React-Maps:  Pitfalls and Struggles from a Beginner Coder\r\n\r\n**Talk Description:**\r\n Coding is hard.  Even harder when you can't just search StackOverflow for an answer.  Here are a few issues that were incredibly small but ate up ridiculous amounts of time while working with the google-react-maps and react-bootstrap.\r\n\r\n1. Size Matters:  The div box needs to be greater than 0.  This is great, unless you're using react-bootstrap.  Then you've got flex containers that are 0 because it's waiting on google-react-maps, which is waiting for react-bootstrap, which is waiting for . . . . .\r\n\r\n2. Custom Icons and SVG attributes:  google-react-maps is great for more customization.  Unfortunately, there's a large learning curve to get to that point.  Here I figured out how to use custom SVG icons and pass them into the component.  We'll also look at some attributes of SVG that allow you to customize size, offsets, and more.\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nGee Li\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\ntwitter: @Gee2789\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\n\r\n**Months Available to Speak:** We recommend selecting multiple months (up to 3) that you are available to speak.

I needed a charting library that works as easily as Chart.js (and looks just as great) but lets me take advantage of React's awesome power of composition, performance, and lifecycle. React-Charts is a data visualization library that embodies the spirit of Chart.js in a way that will make react developers swoon and sing praises to the visualization gods.\r\n\r\nI plan on releasing the library live on stage, along with presenting its capabilities and how it stacks up to the competition (objectively of course).  I am also the creator/maintainer of Jumpsuit, React-Table, and React-Form, and still help maintain Chart.js, so I would hopefully be able to instill some learned wisdom from the open source realm and what it takes to build/contribute-to an open source library (and how rewarding it can be)\r\n\r\n**Name**:\r\nTanner Linsley\r\n\r\n**Twitter Handle (optional)**:\r\ntannerlinsley (also my github handle)\r\n\r\n**Website (optional):**\r\nThe react-storybook that I'm using to build the library is at react-charts.js.org.

As a result, a variety of new architecture styles have emerged to attempt to tackle this new pattern, from entirely static pages to heavy client side apps to isomorphic single page app rendering.\r\n\r\nI work at an agency and have had the opportunity to experiment with a number of them across different projects, and have landed on a pattern we call \"hybrid static\" as the most efficient and least confusing. In this pattern, data and templates are shared between compile time and runtime, so you can decide which parts of the app are rendered as static pages or sections, and which parts are rendered dynamically at runtime. For example, if you were building a blog, you might render the first 10 posts on the first page as static html, then dynamically load the next 10 from the same API into the same template using javascript on the client side if the user goes to the next page.

Some viewers are passive, but most are excited to interact with the person running the channel they're watching. Using the in-channel chat box is a great way to converse with your favourite Twitch creator, however this can sometimes feel limited and the response is often delayed. \r\n\r\nSince Twitch chat is run by IRC, we can use NodeJS to listen in the right room and do some really fun things with just a little bit of imagination. In this talk, I'll share my experiences with creating highly entertaining Twitch chat bots that augment the audience's interactions into something much more fun.

I wasn't sure about submitting this given the timing of this month's event, but I think it would be nice to take the opportunity to look back on more innocent times and share some stories of what we built on the campaign and why the people I met there give me some hope for the future."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/357","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/357/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/357/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/357/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/357","id":198076157,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTk3MDM2MzY=","number":357,"title":"Added myself to speaker list","user":{"login":"KISS","id":182383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/182383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS","html_url":"https://github.com/KISS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KISS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-29T22:09:49Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T02:05:46Z","closed_at":"2017-01-06T20:14:47Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/357","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/357","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/357.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/357.patch"},"body":"Working talk titles:\r\n1. Let's not romanticize learning to code. It's challenging: mentally, emotionally and physically.\r\n2. learningToCode == learningAboutYourself\r\n\r\nI’m a self-taught developer, and the process itself was an exercise in learning about myself. At points I was miserable, experiencing bouts of depression and angst, and quitting multiple times. Following the last time I ‘quit learning to program’ I realized there was some part of me that was self-sabotaging, and I decided to quit that instead. So I left my job, got an internship as a junior developer and have been programming full-time since. \r\n\r\nPart of my angst came from this sense that programming was somehow this innate skill I needed to have been born with, or should be able to develop effortlessly. I now feel that’s insane. But, the reality is, there are other people who think the same and the media projects this idea of learning to program / being a programmer as some sort of romance story: You read an article about programming. You take an online class and you’re instantly hooked. It’s meant to be, happiness for everyone! NOPE.\r\n\r\nI feel that we should be sincere and share what the reality of learning to program is really like, regardless of your path. No one experiences it the same way, and sharing mainly the stories of those who were fortunate to excel as programmers, can set others up for failure (or make them feel like they’re failing). Let’s stop romanticizing learning to program / being a programmer - it’s hard, but worth it, if it’s the right fit for you."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/356","id":198063058,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTk2OTQ2MjI=","number":356,"title":"Proposal for 3rd talk: NYC Space/Time Directory","user":{"login":"bertspaan","id":1194896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTQ4OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1194896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan","html_url":"https://github.com/bertspaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertspaan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-29T20:19:49Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T22:44:26Z","closed_at":"2017-01-06T20:14:07Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/356","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/356","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/356.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/356.patch"},"body":"# NYC Space/Time Directory\r\n\r\nThe NYC Space/Time Directory will make urban history accessible through the \r\nkinds of interactive, location-aware tools used to navigate modern \r\ncityscapes.

Tools written with empathy are in a way contagious.\n\n[This](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans) is my jumping off point , but I also want to pick up some ideas form a talk I saw called [Debugging Ember with Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CctE59nvXyw), and a bit about how these types of tools imfluence the work I do in healthcare.\n\nAlso, I didn't escape my & because I never know when to do that.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/336","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/336/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/336/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/336/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/336","id":180791132,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODc4MjM3MDY=","number":336,"title":"Jenna wants to talk about engineering management and virtual cats","user":{"login":"jennazee","id":1097241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTcyNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1097241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jennazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennazee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-04T02:17:46Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T14:48:51Z","closed_at":"2016-10-07T14:48:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/336","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/336","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/336.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/336.patch"},"body":"I've realized that Engineering Management is actually kinda like Neko Atsume, with a little bit of Pokemon.

The audience can then modify the ram using a (spooky) currency to change the fate of the unsuspecting player.

This talk teaches how to make art in the style of LeWitt's wall drawings with CSS and JavaScript, and along the way provides some insight into the history of procedural art, the nature of randomness, and how tools and algorithms for creating art lead to new forms of collaboration.\n\n---\n\nThis talk was selected for NationJS and I want to beta-test it on the BrooklynJS audience before I take it on the road.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/313","id":167435954,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Nzg3MzA1MjA=","number":313,"title":"Digital Storytelling Through the SVG ViewBox","user":{"login":"ZeeJab","id":1824988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQ5ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1824988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab","html_url":"https://github.com/ZeeJab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZeeJab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-25T18:39:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T18:43:07Z","closed_at":"2016-08-04T18:43:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/313","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/313","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/313.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/313.patch"},"body":"The web has historically been a one-dimensional medium: start at the top and scroll down.

Beyond radically shaping Detroit's geographic and physical space, this has a profound impact on housing in Detroit–a majority African American city that was among the most heavily affected areas during the 2008 economic crisis.\n\nOur hope is that this map can be used as a tool to increase transparency in Detroit's property market, inform policy makers and the media, and help support community activists fighting against housing injustice in Detroit and elsewhere.\n\nThis talk will briefly sketch how I became involved in this project, what I learned about my hometown, how I used [CartoDB](cartodb.com), [Ember](emberjs.com), and [Leaflet](leafletjs.com) to visualize the result of our research, and our hope for how the project can support housing rights activism.\n\nThis will be very loosely based on talks I gave at the [Allied Media Conference](https://www.alliedmedia.org/amc) earlier in June and [JS.Geo](http://www.jsgeo.com) last October.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/305","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/305/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/305/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/305/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/305","id":163578129,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzYwOTc0OTk=","number":305,"title":"Proposal: A cartoon deepdive into React's virtual DOM","user":{"login":"linclark","id":105464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/105464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark","html_url":"https://github.com/linclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-07-03T20:18:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T17:33:29Z","closed_at":"2016-07-07T17:33:29Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/305","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/305","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/305.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/305.patch"},"body":"I hope I'm not too late to propose!

I'll explain what an ESP8266 is, how you can run Javascript on it, and a demonstrate a live interactive web app running on the device.\n\nOutline:\n- What's an ESP8266 — and what does it do?\n- What is Espruino?\n- Interactive live demo\n- How to build your own.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/298","id":160986100,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzQzMTM1NjM=","number":298,"title":"Solving the JavaScript Problem with Elm","user":{"login":"noahzgordon","id":7379855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzk4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7379855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon","html_url":"https://github.com/noahzgordon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahzgordon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-17T22:25:51Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T17:32:36Z","closed_at":"2016-07-07T17:32:36Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/298","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/298","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/298.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/298.patch"},"body":"# Solving the JavaScript Problem with Elm\n\nTen minutes is not a lot of time to introduce an entire language; instead, the very least I can do is explain why I used to be completely unexcited about working on the front end, and now I find myself submitting a talk proposal to a JavaScript meeting.\n\nThe \"JavaScript Problem\" is the name I give the following three issues:\n- Lack of function arity in JS, which is solved by technologies like TypeScript and Flow\n- Lack of an enforced programming paradigm in JS, which is solved by frameworks like Angular, Ember and React/Flow\n- Lack of a community consensus around the way to solve the previous two things, which results in \"JavaScript fatigue\" and is _sort of_ solved (but also compounded) by bundlers and transpilers like Browserify, Babel and Webpack\n\nElm is an incredible language that compiles to JavaScript for use on the client side while cleverly solving each these issues. In this talk I will demonstrate how Elm addresses them with its strong typing system, the Elm Architecture and a conscious philosophy centered around simplicity and user-friendliness. That may seem like a lot for a ten-minute presentation, but I think that small, illustrative examples will speak for themselves.\n\nI will also show you where you can go for more juicy Elm deets and how you can easily get started on your own.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/297","id":158576570,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzI2NDEzNzA=","number":297,"title":"update

It has some very different design goals and constraints to Babel, which might be interesting to explore.\n\nMostly I'd like to talk about the approach to code transformation. Typically, the way that compilers work (as far as I can tell – certainly in Babel's case) is to generate an AST from the source code, analyse that AST, manipulate it, then generate code from it. Bublé skips the last two steps, modifying the code in place instead. This approach is _waaaay_ faster, and doesn't bork up your formatting and code style. And it's done in a way that you still get sourcemaps etc.\n\nUnless you think that's too in-the-weeds in which case there are a few other angles:\n- ES2015 footguns\n- pragmatic vs ideological programming\n- you say NIH, I say progress\n- designing APIs around humans, rather than the implementation\n\nCheers!\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/274","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/274/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/274/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/274/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/274","id":151404979,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjgwNjYyMTk=","number":274,"title":"My Favorite JS Quotes","user":{"login":"courajs","id":1588273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODgyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1588273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs","html_url":"https://github.com/courajs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/courajs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-27T14:48:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T18:34:24Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T18:34:24Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/274","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/274","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/274.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/274.patch"},"body":"JavaScript is a very expressive language.

Javascript not doing it for you? Try Coffeescript. CSS not working out? Try SASS.  But over time, people gravitate towards solutions which allow them to write code using syntax that will work natively in the future.  Why use Coffeescript when you've got ES6?! Why use SASS when you've got PostCSS+CSSNext?!\n\nFor the view, when concatenating a string doesn't work out, we rely on templating engines like Handlebars and Nunjucks, or on more recent approaches like React's JSX.  But do you expect browsers to have native support for these technologies?  \n\nThe solution?! https://github.com/maxogden/yo-yo!

Maybe some people will be more creative than just an image and a link!\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/262","id":142659701,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjM3MjQyNzk=","number":262,"title":"Update index.html","user":{"login":"oliverfriedmann","id":1974785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzQ3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1974785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann","html_url":"https://github.com/oliverfriedmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverfriedmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-22T14:03:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:15Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T22:06:15Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/262","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/262","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/262.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/262.patch"},"body":"We'd like to introduce our open sourced fully responsive video recorder and player.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/261","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/261/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/261/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/261/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/261","id":142413917,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjM2MDAxODA=","number":261,"title":"Taking care of gifness","user":{"login":"veltman","id":2120446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjA0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2120446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman","html_url":"https://github.com/veltman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veltman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-21T17:22:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T21:54:00Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T21:54:00Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/261","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/261","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/261.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/261.patch"},"body":"I love the explanatory power of gifs, and lately I've been chasing the notion of how to best write JS animations and automatically turn them into gifs without screen capture.

Unlike Sublime, Atom, etc., which assume the editor runs on the same computer as the code, webcoder lets you work from any computer's web browser regardless of where the code lives/runs on. So you could store and run your code on a a Digital Ocean instance and and edit the code from any computer that can run a web browser. It's certainly not as full featured as pretty much any other code editor, but it does syntax highlighting for a bunch of languages (including JS), has a folder navigator, and Ctrl-P fast file search.

Maybe some people will be more creative than just an image and a link!\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/247","id":131184251,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTgyMTYxNjM=","number":247,"title":"Speaker Proposal: Samsara.js - Reactive layout for the web","user":{"login":"dmvaldman","id":796394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/796394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman","html_url":"https://github.com/dmvaldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmvaldman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-03T23:05:59Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T00:29:40Z","closed_at":"2016-02-05T00:29:40Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/247","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/247","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/247.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/247.patch"},"body":"I'd like to talk about an open source side-project of mine: https://github.com/dmvaldman/samsara.

spent the past two years studying social media algorithms, harassment, and online communities. I created a performance art piece called \"Social Media Break Up Coordinator\" where I give users advice about their social media practices. I'm part life coach, part SEO specialists. But the advice is all algorithmically driven. Users fill out a 21 point quiz, and depending upon what they say, I give them specific, automated responses. This project is also a way for me to collect data around how people use social media, and how connected people are to the privacy policies of social media. I was really interested in seeing what people would say and if they would pay me to be an emotional mechanical turk. The project is also inspired by the sharing economy with the wondering of should we outsource certain things, and emotional hardships to someone, and can we automate that? It's incredibly hard to automate emotion with an algorithm, but it's a lot easier to intervene as a human. This project fits in-between those spaces- part human, and part algorithm, but all designed to fit into the spaces where social media breaks down and falls us, and a new person or thing can step in and help mitigate- be it a work problem, family, friendship or romantic.\n"}][{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/242","id":128543699,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTcwNzQ4NzQ=","number":242,"title":"Update

We're working off of a MEAN stack and are really interested in data visualization, improving government services, and building accessible and inclusive technology for all New Yorkers.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/239","id":128218673,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTY5MjU4MjA=","number":239,"title":"Speaker Proposal","user":{"login":"nodebotanist","id":148924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/148924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist","html_url":"https://github.com/nodebotanist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodebotanist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-22T18:47:50Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T00:31:45Z","closed_at":"2016-02-05T00:31:45Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/239","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/239","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/239.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/239.patch"},"body":"Let me know if my formatting is off!

I believe the answer is code that expressively employs the power of architecture to clearly communicate with the reader, leaving minimal room for confusion or misunderstanding.  What is beautiful in C will be different than what is beautiful in Smalltalk, and both will be different than beautiful Haskell code.\n\nOften the language itself imposes the paradigm, but Javascript is so easy-going we have to decide for ourselves what type of code we want to create.  Despite the extra work this makes for us, it also allows for innovations that would go against the grain in any other language.  We can write code that is beautiful the way functional code is beautiful, or code that is beautiful the way object-oriented code is beautiful, but it also leaves the door open to novel forms.\n\nOne such new approach is Flux, an architecture pattern that emerged from Facebook.  It is an example of reactive programming, and it can be a mind twist for people used to object-oriented or functional paradigms.  Unfortunately the documentation is expansive and at times obtuse, diving quickly into the weeds.

We manage [wework.com](https://www.wework.com), which is right now in the process of being converted over to a statically generated site (from what used to be built with Ruby on Rails). A few weeks ago -- around xmas, hence the goofy holiday theme ;) -- I gave the following [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t7A5-U9cYor6pMfc6XS2fdVjFicTxClWFig5xQ02KuI/edit?usp=sharing) to wework's engineering team on how we were able to build a specific flow on our site using React Components to generate our html.\n\nUsing React doesn't immediately seem like an obvious choice when you're talking about static site generation, something typically done for simpler marketing websites. However, take a look at [airbnb's](https://www.airbnb.com/) help widget:\n\n![screen shot 2016-01-02 at 2 00 33 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4423173/12075757/4080a174-b159-11e5-9981-31f0378eab5b.png)\n\nYou're looking at a simple static site, with now a super complex react component inserted onto it.\n\nGiven the 15 minute time limit, I'd like to reduce the presentation linked above and focus more on the advantages and disadvantages of using React when you're using a Static Site Generator. This will touch on how we're able to build these one of components like airbnb's help widget, make them statically render for SEO purposes (the equivalent to \"server side render\" for you React nerds), and most importantly make them work on all browsers (yes, including IE 8!). \n\nAlso if you're curious, my colleague wrote a wonderful article on [why we embraced static site generation](http://engineering.wework.com/engineering/2015/12/08/why-wework-com-uses-a-static-generator-and-why-you-should-too/).\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/226","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/226/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/226/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/226/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/226","id":124004741,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQ2MjczMjI=","number":226,"title":"Talk

a beginner using git, you're often told that amending commits should only be done locally, and that you should never, ever, ever force push. However, a lot of open source repositories on GitHub use a system for pull requests where you are _expected_ to amend commits and force push. In this talk, I'd like to talk about what they mean by this, and I want to talk about your options for updating a pull request when a repository maintainer asks you to. My talk is aimed at both beginners who have opened their first PR with a spelling error, and at maintainers who may not be aware that asking people to update their PR can be confusing. \n\nA full post about what I want to cover can also be found [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md). \n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/208","id":114383560,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDkzNDAxODU=","number":208,"title":"In Defense Of CoffeeScript","user":{"login":"morleyzhi","id":1668327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjgzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1668327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi","html_url":"https://github.com/morleyzhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morleyzhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-31T02:59:34Z","updated_at":"2015-11-20T20:50:44Z","closed_at":"2015-11-16T22:45:46Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/208","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/208","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/208.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/208.patch"},"body":"I'd like to give a talk about CoffeeScript.

I'll talk about:\n- How I wrote the runtime that compiles the user's code to bytecode and runs it on the VM.\n- How the runtime supports stepping forwards and backwards through the code. \n- How I wrote the parser and runtime to produce very specific, jargon-free, context-aware error messages.\n- How I designed the programming language to avoid some of the pitfalls of JS.\n\nCode Lauren is deployed at http://codelauren.com\n\nThanks!\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/205","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/205/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/205/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/205/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/205","id":111861021,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDc5Mjg4NzI=","number":205,"title":"Proposed talk: Open Source Email Client in Electron, React, and Flux","user":{"login":"emorikawa","id":489001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTAwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/489001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa","html_url":"https://github.com/emorikawa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emorikawa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-10-16T16:03:11Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T19:07:38Z","closed_at":"2015-12-03T19:07:38Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/205","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/205","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/205.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/205.patch"},"body":"I’d like to talk about building cross-platform desktop apps with Electron, React, Flux, and Node.

I've learned a ton trying to jerry rig this project together, and would like to talk about how I problem solved some issues that came up - for instance, how do you deal with different React components for different types of documents? How do you get Oauth to work without a popup? How do you sync offline using Pouch and Couch and localStorage? How do you deal with Chrome's native PDF API (short answer; you don't, it doesn't exist).

Transpilers & You, Or Write Your Own Language & Compile for the Web\n\nDo you love the web but hate Javascript syntax? Are there libraries you use everyday, whose boilerplate you dream of hiding away once and for all? Clearly the right answer is to create your own domain-specific language that compiles to JS, a personal Babel if you will, all in your own spare time.\n\nNo, wait, come back! \n\nIn this talk I will cover the outlines of creating your own language, including PEGs (parsing expression grammars), the path code takes from the lexer to behavior, and tools attendees can use to create their own works, in particular PLTJS (and, permission pending, a new, not-quite-released tool).\n\nI will also discuss the process around the development of [Data Monster](https://github.com/sarahgp/data-monster), my domain-specific language that compiles to d3.js and is hosted in Javascript.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/170","id":92187113,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg5MTg1ODQ=","number":170,"title":"propose

I've been working on a new project called [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) that I'd love to debut at 61 Local.\n\nIt's basically like an ES6-native version of Browserify or Webpack, but with a crucial difference. Because ES6 modules are designed to be statically analysable in a way that's more or less impossible with AMD and CommonJS, it's possible to be incredibly efficient about what code gets included in your bundle - in some cases the result is a small fraction of the size of the equivalent Browserify/Webpack bundle. (Even in the worst case it will still be a decent amount slimmer.)\n\nReason I'm excited about this project is that it potentially eliminates some of the constraints we've imposed on ourselves. The whole 'every JS package should be a small, focused module' idea that's dominated for the last few years seems like a self-evident Good Thing, but falls apart on close inspection - among other things, it prioritises the needs of package authors over package consumers. ES6 modules will mean richer, more learnable libraries, that are significant enough to build communities around, and web development will become easier as a result. (I'll explain why in the talk.) But only if we start embracing ES6 modules soon.\n\nSo I'd love to talk about what the project does, how it works, and how people can help drive AMD and CommonJS into the past where they belong.\n\nJust to prove that this isn't totally pie-in-the-sky, the next version of D3 is built with ES6 modules and bundled with Rollup. Some of the famous D3 examples can be made roughly 95% smaller as a result!\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/166","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/166/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/166/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/166/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/166","id":89645489,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzgxNDEyODE=","number":166,"title":"Gordon

Explain what [`godot`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/godot) is and how it builds on streams to easily write your own custom monitoring solution. \n\nI will explain the concept of [`producers`](https://github.com/jcrugzz/producer) (which can be ANY readable stream) to generate some standard [metrics](https://github.com/jcrugzz/memory-producer) from your node process and show how you can also use the `client.produce()` method to generate any application specific metrics. Dive into [`reactors`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/godot#reactors) which are simply `transform` or `through` streams that can be used to filter, aggregate or calculate various metrics from your data on the fly!\n\nAlong with the overview, I will be giving a live demo of how we can integrate monitoring into a simple `http` application and setup a [`godot`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/godot) server to begin monitoring it.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/31","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/31/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/31/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/31/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/31","id":26830738,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTIxNDc5NDg=","number":31,"title":"Talk Proposal","user":{"login":"ameensol","id":2306490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2306490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol","html_url":"https://github.com/ameensol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ameensol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-02-03T19:37:42Z","updated_at":"2014-06-26T16:20:31Z","closed_at":"2014-02-07T03:48:30Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/31","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/31","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/31.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/31.patch"},"body":"**Untangling the Semantic Web**\n\nIntro - What is the Semantic Web?

The concept is that throwing HTML at the browser is no longer the best way to build web apps - that worked for static documents, and it kind of worked for apps that make heavy use of client-side string-based templating (e.g. Handlebars), but for a lot of modern apps we need something smarter.\n\nHence the idea of a UI library ([Ractive.js](http://ractivejs.org)) that parses HTML itself and creates a virtual DOM (a bit like React's) in order to do data-binding and event handling etc. Meteor are currently replacing their UI layer with something that takes a very similar approach, and Ember are replacing Handlebars with 'HTMLBars' which is also a very similar idea, so as counter-intuitive as it sounds, it's the future of UI libraries and MVC frameworks. I think it's a really important idea but I haven't really seen people talking about it yet.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/20","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/20/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/20/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/20/events","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/20","id":26299206,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTE4NzYyODQ=","number":20,"title":"Propose 1st talk: Writing a Lisp interpreter in JS","user":{"login":"maryrosecook","id":2716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook","html_url":"https://github.com/maryrosecook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryrosecook/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":99254829,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTI1NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-01-25T19:24:00Z","updated_at":"2014-05-13T14:50:22Z","closed_at":"2014-02-07T01:44:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pulls/20","html_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/20","diff_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/20.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/pull/20.patch"},"body":"- Mary Rose Cook\n- I'll explain the code for a simple Lisp interpreter in JavaScript.
