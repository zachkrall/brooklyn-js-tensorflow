 GSAP 3 is GreenSock's largest update yet, with over 50 new features and half the file size of the old TweenMax. This talk will cover some of the new features and how they can make your job of animating easier.P.S. I work for GreenSock 💚And I have stickers!,We love to throw around the phrase 'Design System', but what does is actually mean to build a useful one? If your codebase isn't standardized, where do you start? What tools are out there to help? This talk will cover how to successfully build a Design System that people like to use, and how to avoid some of the pitfalls along the way. Inspired by what I've learned while building a Design System at Nomad Health., BrooklynJS Talk SubmissionI've given all three talks before at some conferences. I'd be happy to do any of them! Let me know if it's be easier to read through them as separate issues and I can separate them. Talk 1 Reviving the Dream of the 90s with WebGLIf you’re like me, you’ve spent hours staring at Windows 98 screensavers when you were growing up. Sadly, screensavers are no more, but we’ve got the power to fix that. In this talk, I’ll walk you through how to harness modern technology to revive the dream of the 90s. Using A-Frame and other modern web technologies, I’ll show you how to recreate some iconic imagery, including 3D Pipes, The Maze, and The Matrix screensavers.Demo httpsbillyroh.comscreensavers Talk 2 Learning through Art An Introduction to VRVirtual reality can be daunting—it’s unclear what you can do with it and it’s hard to know where to even start. I’ll introduce you to fundamental VR concepts by re-creating an interactive installation art piece by Yayoi Kusama in A-Frame, a VR web framework. So you can try it out at home, I’ll also walk you through the ecosystem of VR libraries and affordable hardware that’s currently out there.Demo httpsbillyroh.comobliteration Talk 3 Albers as a MillennialWhat kind of art would Josef and Anni Albers have made if they were millennials? Come learn about how to make generative interactive art with the magic of JavaScript. The audience will learn about applying colour theory with HSL, composing and generating your own patterns with SVG, and creating a sense of depth with motion and interaction.Demo httpsbillyroh.comalbers About me Billy RohPronouns hehimTwitter Handle (optional) @billyrohWebsite (optional) httpsbillyroh.comMonths Available to Speak November, December, January,In a few labs around the world, the next generation of computers are being built out of "qubits". If a quantum computer is connected to the internet, we can program it in JavaScript! I'm not a physicist, so I'll do a high-level overview of what qubits might be useful for, then present Quantum-Peep, a TypeScript module which I've written to generate quantum assembly code for the four leading quantum computing services IBM, Rigetti, Google, and Microsoft.I submitted talk 550 earlier this year but had to leave town. Now that Quantum Supremacy is in the news, I'm bringing it back, scans, stickers, memes, cease+desists, and children with computers.   ,I'd to talk about some pitfalls of developing in a browser context, particularly when there are "higher powers" like the operating system or an embedding app affecting what events make their way down to the JS world. I'd like to mention a few examples, like browsers eating keyboard shortcuts, Safari placing the on-screen keyboard on top of the window, and apps like Instagram and Snapchat preventing gestures from reaching a webview, along with some workarounds and approaches to testing.,Would love to get an updated number on funds donated to date, but the budget is really stale (see also httpsgithub.combrooklynjsbrooklynjs.github.ioissues523)... I realize it's a thankless task, but can someone bring it up to date?,Abstract With the release of ES10 aka ES2019, our lives as JavaScript developers just got a little bit easier. I'll go over some of the new features including `Object.fromEntries()`, `trimStart()`, `flatMap()`, optional catch binding, and more that we can start using in our code. I'll be using spoookkyy examples 👻 to stay on the Halloween theme., A while back, I was looking for a side project to do, and decided to make a clone of Cookie Clicker. Digging into the math behind how that game works taught me some disturbing things about how easy it is for a piece of software to get its hooks into a user's brain. Now I'd like to spread that disturbed feeling to you!,A rundown of the ways people have put things side by side in CSS from the well known (table -> float -> flexbox) to the rare (table -> inline-block -> js + absolute -> grid) with some funny examples of the failure of each, as well as the timeline of when each method came into fashion  became irrelevant.Will end the talk on the black magic table layout that is commonly used in responsive email templates.My experience comes from building and maintaining a number of large styleguides  grid systems for clients (as team.pizza) and full-time positions, teaching advanced CSS workshops at Thinkful, and working on responsive email there. - no spoilers,This talk will go through the processes we used to make sure we created quality sample code for the launch of Twitter Developer Labs. The outline of this talk will be as followsWhat is Twitter Developer Labs?Twitter Developer Labs is a new program that allows developers to partner with us to create and shape the future of our API. These releases allow developers to test and share feedback on previews of new API products and features.Why create sample code?The main objective is helping us get to hello world faster and inspiring folks to build with the new APIs.Accessibility Developers who use our API come from many different backgrounds and skill sets. What does good sample code look likeGood sample code focuses on the following- Readability - Easy to replicate without complicated set up- Consistent What we learned in this processOur key lessons were as follows- The importance of peer review- Making Hello World as easy as possible I’ll conclude with next steps and how to reach out to me., I'm a front end developer from Mexico City that ended up in NYC working doing DevOps stuff, having been the first or second engineering hire on the last 3 companies I worked at,I have some hard earned insight into bootstrapping a modern™ front end applications on nothing but s3, cloud front and lambda. In this talk I would explain the stack to deploy weekend-side-project applications that cost cents a month to maintain. Using only JS(and some terraform).,This is a talk about generating talks.When we feed historical data to a machine learning process, can we actually generate new ideas?What can we learn about ourselves by observing our mathematically warped reflections?I scraped data from the Brooklyn.js GitHub repository containing 198 previous talk submissions. From that data, I generated a model using a LSTM (long short-term memory) recurrent neural network process with Tensorflow.js. In this talk, I will review the tools and steps taken for this project from start to finish. Lastly, I will demo the resulting talk submissions., Visual learners need more robust tools for learning to code. I'll discuss how I built AlgoViz, a full featured and customizable algorithm visualizer. Designed with ease of use and visual aesthetics in mind, AlgoViz can show you the execution of your code, including its involved data structures and expressions. I'll go into detail about how I combined the concepts of meta-programming and reactive-programming to make transforming code into a visualization possible, as well as some of the major challenges I faced when writing the JS that does that., The best way to learn about and truly understand some of the built in JavaScript methods is to rewrite them. In this talk we'll do that with `map`. Then we'll do it again without using for loops. While it's impractical, rewriting map with recursion will let us explore some of the foundations of functional programming. We'll end with a brief discussion of the lambda calculus, and whether or not we can rewrite `map`, in principle, with nothing but anonymous functions.,babel-fish is an on-the-fly optimized JavaScript transpiler. It acts as a reverse proxy for JavaScript resources and uses information about the requesting browser to optimize transpilation and polyfill addition to make full use of native browser features that are available in the requesting agent. This results in smaller, more performant bundles for newer browsers.It applies 3 main optimizations techniques- dynamic transpilation minimum transpilation possible on the request file for the requesting browser- dynamic polyfill only polyfill what's needed for the requested file to run on the requesting browser- dynamic compression uses the best compression algorithm (gzip, deflate or brotli) supported by the requesting browserbabel-fish was originally created to be used with VHS3 (NYT media player). Therewe saw a 16% drop in bundle size on the uncompressed asset and 30% drop on thecompressed asset by using better minification and compression algorithms.!final-bundle-size-chart, I recently co-created Crato, a framework to make setting up centralized log management for small applications easy. Crato is built with Node, bash, Apache Kafka, InfluxDB and AWS S3. It is deployed with Docker. In this talk I briefly introduce the notion of offsite centralized log management and then discuss some interesting problems (and our solutions) encountered in building this framework.,Utilizing the Web Audio API, this project aims to generate real-time changes to the DOM based on the frequency analysis of an incoming audio signal.  Designed with the pairing of a  synthesizer or other direct input of an electronic device in mind, the Web Audio API (with assistance of the Wad.js library), analyzes the frequency (pitch) of an audio signal and returns the frequency (as a number) and note  (as a string).  These values are then assigned to different parameters of the DOM and styles, such as background color, image source retrieval, and others; and with these updates being done in very short time frames (<20 milliseconds), the effect is real-time rendering of visual elements synchronized to the music of the performer.,  This investigative talk walks through the source code of react-scripts (the vehicle behind create-react-app's npm commands) in order to uncover the technical details of what exactly happens when you `npm run eject`. We'll conclude with a round-up of risks involved and possible failsafes of ejecting a CRA, and incidentally learn some advanced features of npmnode's architecture along the way.After previously speaking at BrooklynJS in 2016, I'm excited to submit another talk for your consideration!, this talk strays from my usual instead of technical lessons and takeaways, I'll be talking about my personal journey as an independent creator of dataviz.  I'll be talking about past projects that have defined my data visualization styles, and future projects I'm excited about., Ok, maybe not _all_ of them, and maybe not _basically_ the same, but there are a lot of features in common! Let's explore them using _General Language Syntax (GLS)_, a cute little experimental language that compiles a code  syntax into the equivalent language-specific code in C, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and TypeScript.  This talk will give an overview of how languages can seem the same on the surface but behave subtly differently on the inside.Relevant repositories GLS,I don't know about you, but I'm seriously tired of having to run through 15 README steps to setup a project only to find out that I have the wrong version of Python. Also, WHY DO I EVEN NEED PYTHON?!?This is what it's like to setup a new project or framework. Developers have been stuck on this carousel of insanity for far too long. It's time to shut it off. Let's never configure another development environment ever again. Instead, lets put the entire thing in Github. I know that sounds like sarcasm, but it's actually for real. All you need is two text files. I'll show you how.,HTTP is stateless. This is by design and that is what makes serverless great for modern day HTTP APIs. There's always a grey area -- imagine setting up a timer on your server to send a calendar notification after x number of days. At that point you want your HTTP request to _remember_ what time the notification should be sent out. Durable Serverless Functions are a new type of serverless functions that gives you the tools you need to make your APIs stateful.,At Lemonade, we wanted our new German users to have a delightful experience - but more importantly, a German one. To achieve this, we needed to create a translation mechanism that allowed us to mix plaintext translations with richer content like links or any other `JSX` components. Additionally, creating these dynamic translations on the fly can be expensive, so we took some steps to reduce performance pitfalls, and avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`., I'd like to share my experiences developing on the Ethereum blockchain network featuring an app that provides a platform, for individuals with less freedom of speech than ours, to communicate anonymously and without restrictions by utilizing blockchain's immutable properties., We started using React Hooks for elizabethwarren.com when they were still in an alpha stage. I’d like to share our experience using hooks in production and give a brief introduction to how it changes the way you develop React components.,At Doist, since very early on, and it is now available in 18 languages. In this talk, we will share with you some lessons we learned when working with localization.,This Drake-themed talk will go over the three AWS services used to build my IVR (Interactive Voice Response), what I learned along the way, takeaways, and a few other AWS services used at New York Times. This talk was inspired by NYT's new automated phone system for customer service that my team and I built this year. Many people are familiar with S3 cloud storage, but AWS offers a lot of software and services that power things like Slack, Alexa, messenger bots, etc.Following the same process of building 1-800-NYTIMES customer service phone line, I will go over how I built an IVR where you call a number and have to complete the lyrics to Drake's Hotline Bling song to continue to the next prompt in the call flow. If all goes right with audio setup, I can demo it by calling the number.!image,It's common knowledge that accessibility matters but when looking for content on how to build accessible web apps, it often gets restricted to things such as adding `aria-label` and `aria-hidden` to elements when in reality, we are building interfaces that are much more complex. In this talk, I present a few common UI elements and how to make them more accessible with proper semantics and some less known aria attributes.,90% of your day is searching for information how to get home, how to get to work, what podcast to listen to, who to curate into your twitter feed. If you are building a product that offers content, and your users need to find specific content, then you need to build a search engine.But building an effective search engine that meets your users’ needs is not easy. When we search for something, we have expectations that the engine will help us find things that we want easily or help us stumble upon things that we like and didn’t know existed. I want to change the narrative of content discovery. I will enumerate problems search engines solve - and don’t solve - based on your content and users. I will discuss my personal experiences with search engines being abused as databases and used in contexts where curation would have yielded better results for users with lower engineering costs. You will learn how to develop product hypotheses when you don’t have insights into your users just yet.,How can we continue to apply the Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well when we make APIs and SPAs with dozens of features? We identify the most reusable and composable aspects of our tools. We'll look at code that stands the test of time and give you tips to write some too.The Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well and are composable has left a lasting mark on computer science. Most of us use the command line every day. We try to write code that is modular, reusable, and simple. We understand that simple does not equal easy. We know that foundational components of the machines we use every day were written decades ago.And yet web development in the last fifteen years or so may feel to some like a possessed carousel spinning so fast that before you get familiar with one JS framework, it's getting thrown off the side in favor of the next.I'll argue understanding essential JS, your code in general, and some of its strongest and most useful components will also help you create small and light pieces that compose and customize to your needs. Understanding a bit of the history of the command line tools we use every day will cement the understanding of how valuable these tenets are, and will give you a stronger appreciation of the gurus from the days of punchcards and room-sized mainframes that held less data than your watch. Let's learn some of their lessons, adapted for our modern age.,Five minutes, that’s how long the average salary negotiation lasts. This five minutes have an outsized impact on everything in your life from what you’re eating for dinner to where your kids go to college. In this talk, we’ll cover important tips and tricks for negotiating your salary at a new job. We’ll also cover some fundamentals about stock options and venture funding.,Would be a talk about the content in this article.httpswww.freecodecamp.orgnewsself-positioning-react-components-2- This is a re-post from here --> httpshackernoon.comself-positioning-react-components-7e5d99e9349f,Would be a talk about the content in this article.httpswww.freecodecamp.orgnewsself-positioning-react-components-2- This is a re-post from here --> httpshackernoon.comself-positioning-react-components-7e5d99e9349f, The Web is an imperfect and ever-evolving platform, and has been heavily influenced by frameworks like Dojo, MooTools, and jQuery. Frameworks can fill in the gaps where Web APIs fall short, and sometimes even point us toward the future of Web.`document.querySelectorAll` was born out of jQuery, CSS Grid has a long lineage with roots in Microsoft Silverlight, and smooshGate demonstrated how the advancement of Web APIs is inextricably linked to legacy frameworks deployed years ago.Should we build React into the browser? Let’s explore the interplay between Web frameworks of today and Web APIs of tomorrow, and use the Web's history to make some predictions about how modern frameworks will make their way into the Web ~3.0~, ~4.0~, which version is this?, I want to share with the collaboration between the NYC Dept of Ed and Processing Foundation has yielded in the CSforAll program in Brooklyn and beyond., BrooklynJS Talk SubmissionHot Reload... for your entire stackTalk One of js's key strengths is velocity. It's easy to hit save and see the page update. This is so important that new tools that make js more powerful and complicated also have to keep reload quick (webpack, typescript, babel).But what if your backend isn't js? Or what if you update `package.json`, but forget to run `npm install`? Or what if you use containers and fast compiles are swamped by slow image builds?You deserve Hot Reload for your entire stack. And it's possible.I'll show Hot Reload in all the components of a demo app that includes js in the browser, a python frontend, and a go backend.Dan BentleyPronounsHeHimTwitter Handle (optional)@dbentleyMonths Available to SpeakJune, July, August,Zeerust] is an emulator for the Z80] I wrote in Rust while at Recurse center. After I finished it, I realised that probably nobody was ever going to run it again, some random rust binary. But if I made it a webapp, maybe I could get people to play with it!Rust can compile to WebAssembly, so I set out to make a frontend for it. I found a project called yew], which let me write a React-style frontend entirely in Rust, making communication with my emulator easy! The finished emulator lives at zeerust.stillinbeta.com,ezeerust].In this talk, I'll discuss the trials of doing pure-web assembly development, how I went about deploying it, and what the development loop likes with in Rust. zeerust] httpsgithub.comstillinbetazeerustZ80] httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiZilog_Z80yew] httpsdocs.rsyew0.6.0yewindex.htmlezeerust] httpszeerust.stillinbeta.com,In this talk I will present brief overview of chapters 1-7 of a seminal paper by Moseley and Marks "Out of The Tar Pit" (2006).Every day we, as software developers, deal with code which can he hard to maintain, prone to bugs, and difficult to reason about. As an embedded software developer I faced exactly those problems, maybe even more exagerrated by the specifics of firmware engineering.For me reading "Out of The Tar Pit" proved to be an eye opening experience and allowed me to become a better developer, who is conscious about many faces of code complexities and effective maintenance of stateful code.This paper gave s to things my gut feeling was telling me were wrong, classified them, explained why they are bad, and provided guidance on how to keep them in check., Nowadays, products with electronic features are being used in every part of our lives. Like all products, these need to be tested as well. When designing them, this is where it comes to electrical engineering and programming – skills not all designers and product developers possess. However, especially in the early stages of product development, it is important to test if an idea works. blokdots](, Understand what test flakiness is, the impact it has, and how to overcome it.,TypeScript is great for writing safe code, but honestly who wants to write a bunch of boilerplate type code in like every other file. There's gotta be a way to get nice autocomplete and type info WITHOUT totally changing how we write code, right?? (spoiler alert yes) This talk will explore how we can use TypeScript features like intersections alongside more general programming patterns to make really nifty APIs ✨., As frontend (and even backend) developers, we really only need to concern ourselves with the Application Layer (layer 7 of the OSI model and where HTTP resides). But what goes on at the lower layers, particularly those involved with routing and transport is fascinating and helps us have a greater understanding of how the web works. It's how we're able to serve a website to the world, hit an API, and even pair program with our boss.Major topics- What's a network?- Routing- MAC addresses and IP addresses- DNS- TCP vs UDP- PingMinor, fun topics- Duplexing,Often, the endeavors of hiring and mentoring junior engineers and of bolstering diversity and inclusion efforts are seen as “nice to haves” at best and “extraneous” (or even “impossible”!) at worst. But in reality, building diversity and inclusivity and fostering the ability to incorporate junior engineers go hand-in-hand. Engineering teams should approach each of these efforts in service of the other.Together, we'll articulate the value of investing in mentorship efforts in terms of their impact on the ability to attract and retain diversity. You will walk away with a clearer understanding of the connection between the two efforts, and ideas for incorporating mentorship and D&I processes at your place of work.,The saying, “Those who can, do; those who can't, teach”, is pretty off. Great developers are able to understand concepts well enough to share their knowledge with others effectively. The Web is an ever-expanding piece of technology, and we will have to adapt by learning more and more new tools that can enhance experiences for users. We will constantly be living between feeling like we know nothing and feeling like we know everything there is to know. However, every so often we will come across tools that we have been able to master. Along with a feeling of accomplishment, we may want to share that knowledge with others. This talk will explain the science around learning, tools for getting the most out of our learning, and how we can empower others to learn from and with us., Just 20 years ago, the term "open source" didn't even exist. The majority of industry software was sold in binary form, and the idea of building a business by giving away source code for free was inconceivable when the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, had built his business, Microsoft, on selling proprietary software. But 20 years later, "open,1] source,2] has,3] won,4]" the majority of the tech industry runs on open source software, and even Microsoft has joined the movement, acquiring,5] and contributing to the largest open source development platform in the world!1] httpswww.wired.com201608open-source-won-now2] httpswww.computerworld.comarticle3144063open-source-has-won-and-microsoft-has-surrendered.html3] httpswww.zdnet.comarticlelinux-and-open-source-have-won-get-over-it4] httpsosjournal.comopen-source-has-won-now-it-needs-to-remain-vigilant-2995] httpsblogs.microsoft.comblog20180604microsoft-github-empowering-developersBut if open source has won, do we still need an open source movement? How can we, as a community, grapple with the challenges of sustainable development practices and ethical use of freely released software? In this talk, I'll ponder some of these questions, and propose a vision for the future of the open source software community.Note I am a Director on the Open Source Initiative's Board. However, this talk is proposed in a personal capacity, and I do not speak on behalf of the OSI.,Haskellers can be pretty smug about our language of choice, but this quickly stops when you ask us how we write applications for a web browser. In fact, there's a page on the Haskell wiki imaginatively titled The JavaScript Problem reasons we have for wanting this, some of the progress we've made towards this goal, and what we have to look forward to!, What would it be like to traverse a star map of songs? Clusters of stars could signify genres, or similar artists or albums. Directions could beckon you towards  more energetic, danceable music, or slower, calmer tracks; depth could take you across genre. This is a problem that inspired me to start coding years ago, and I've recently returned to it and built a prototype](In this talk, I will demo the songmap, and introduce attendees to three.js, working with the Spotify API, and designing a creative UX to visualize and explore music listening preferences. I'll also emphasize the journey and failures in building this, and the iterative steps that took me from a wanna-be coder to the final product.,Testing is hard! But it could be fun! End to end testing could help us to test applications with the way users will interact. But there are challenges making it's hard to implement in practical development cycle  1) it's complicated to setup, configure and integrate to CICD 2) Tests are flaky and painful to debug or maintain. 3) it takes long time to run all tests, etc. Fortunately, we now have Cypress, a faster, easier and reliable testing framework. By using Cypress, E2E testing can reduce time from 1 hour to 4 minutes and it's easy to integrated into CICD. In this talk, I will talk about good features limitations of Cypress and some tricks to make it faster and robust. ,My experience with simple game development using the JavaScript framework Phaser implementing simple physics and a levelroom rendering and design system.Here's the basic game prototype I made a while ago which I would soup up for the talk if I was chosen httpsmattconn.devphaser-js-game,Architecture has often been used as a background for creating and experiencing music. This project looks to invert that relationship by using audio to create virtual 3D environments. Using VR these environments can be experienced as if one was inhabiting the environment.The process of going from audio signals to a 3D environment involves deconstructing the audio into numbers which can be used as an input into parametric algorithms for creating 3D forms. Often the inspiration for such designs has been to express a relationship between an environment and other abstract concepts, supported by engineering and design to make the environments habitable and functional.The ephermal medium of virtual environments remove the shackles of real world and allow for more experimental habitats and enjoyable experiences. The demo application explores a few such concepts by exposing parametric relationships established in architectural design but augmenting them to react to music in real time creating a dynamic music driven world.Demo , Property testing, aka generative testing, is an alternative to unit testing. Instead of manually specifying input and output cases, the developer specifies laws (aka properties) that should hold for _all_ expected input types. The system then generates many random inputs, verifies if the property holds in all cases, and simplifies failing inputs to find error boundaries. This talk will demonstrate the power, ease, and flexibility of property testing in JS.,In a few labs around the world, the next generation of computers - based on qubits - are being designed and connected to the internet. If it's connected to the internet, we must be able to program it in JavaScript! I'm not a physicist, so I'll do a high-level overview of what quantum computers might be useful for, then present Quail, a TypeScript module which I've written to generate quantum assembly code for the three leading quantum cloud services IBM, Rigetti, and Microsoft. Demo will send code to a real quantum computer.,The virtual DOM is the beating heart of many modern frontend frameworks today. While the concept of how it works is straightforward, the only way to understand it is to build one! During this talk, I will live code a tiny lightweight VDOM library from scratch and explore the idea and concepts behind is.,Snapshot testing is one of the best ways to ensure that your UI doesn't change unexpectedly but is often considered only as an afterthought. Complaints of its difficultly to implement, manage, and maintain abound, despite its usefulness in ensuring that unrelated updates don't inadvertently change the UI. Despite its benefits, most people ignore snapshot testing completely and the few who don't simply outsource it. In this talk I'll go over how to build your own snapshot testing suite that can easily be integrated into your CICD pipeline.,Microservices architectures are ridiculous until they're not. Teams grow; repos expand; dependencies multiply; contracts blur---at a certain point, the need to do one thing in several places becomes both too valuable and too expensive for copy-paste coding. What's worse, the evolution of tooling beyond `npm link` keeps bringing that point closer and closer to `git init`.Through a discussion of two ReactRedux codebases and a live coding example, I'd like to talk about the messiest part of adopting microservices making judgment calls about the boundaries between concerns. I'd like to describe the product-oriented approach my team evolved for divvying up the responsibilities of our libraries and services, and how componentization with React and modularization with Webpack and Node made it possible to move past concerning ourselves with the stack.Rachael Leigh Cook's fabulous 1997 _This Is Your Brain On Drugs_ PSA furnishes a title and a framing device. If accepted, you have my solemn promise that my talk will not involve wreckin' up the joint.,What actually happens (under the hood) when you assign a an event handler to a component in React? A breakdown of Native vs Synthetic events and whywhen that even matters.,   From S.M.A.R.T. Goals to productive hacks.The same way we build systems at work is how we should think about achieving the goals we have in or hobbies we have.   The process is more important than the goal and we should look at how building good habits will make you 1% better each day. In this talk I'll talk about how creating better systems for ourselves will allow you to focus on improving skills that result in you becoming who you want in life and tech. ,You may recognize Two-factor Authentication (2FA) as an additional safeguard for protecting accounts, but do you really know how it works? This talk will show you how to implement Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) and explain what's happening under the hood of those expiring tokens. You'll learn the different approaches to implementing 2FA and have a better understanding of what's right for your application.,Performance is crucial to designing a delightful user experience. Yet even products with a 100% Lighthouse score often fall short in some regions of the world. You can determine your performance worldwide by measuring field data with Real User Monitoring (RUM) via Perfume.js. In this talk we’ll study how we use Perfume.js at Coinbase to maximize our performance around the globe.  ,In this talk we will get a quick look at one of React's newest feature React Hooks! ,The basic advantages of using GraphQL are plain to see. But how do you move an existing application across and what decisions are made?Our company builds a widely used customer facing website. We have made the decision to migrate to a GraphQL interface. We shall present a case study of our initial migration, the decisions, the discoveries and arguments for and against GraphQL. When you have an existing revenue generating product you have to justify technology change. We will present our case and describe what technologies we choose and why.,React Hooks, which have generated a ton of excitement and conversation on Twitter the past few weeksmonths, are here, in 16.8, out today! So I guess it's time I went out and learned what they are, and started understanding how to use them.I plan to cover an introduction to Hooks, particularly from the point of view of someone who's familiar with existing react paradigms, and how you might start using them, replace existing tools, or what potentially new things they'd enable that existing options for things like lifecycle and state management didn't.,A new generation of online developer tools aims to replace your IDE with a web app. Are they succeeding? Will these tools be "VSCode in your browser," or will a more diverse set of tools emerge? We will compare specialized and general-purpose development environments in the browser for use today, and look at upcoming libraries and browser technology that might make these tools better in the future. I will also preview some of my work to build a more diverse set of coding tools in the browser.,It's no secret that React and D3.js don't play well together when you're looking for user interaction and animation in your data visualization. I want to give a talk about how to easily do your first data visualization based on using React-Vis and Chart.js.I understand that Tanner stopped by last year to give a talk on Chart.js based on the suggested PR that popped up when I wrote this. I would be giving more of a practitioner perspective of issues I faced rendering charts using 3rd party API's, building a full stack application and alternatives to using React lifecycle methods to re-render charts if you're working with real-time data or want users to change charts inside of a single-page app.,  Originally released in 2011, the Weekender website is one of the MTA's few official works using the iconic Massimo Vignelli map from the 1970s, and a brilliant digital adaptation of the subway system's classic wayfinding sign system, but it's now showing its age as technologies have evolved quickly and users' expectations of digital experiences become ever more sophisticated. In this unofficial "HD remaster," civic technologist Lou Huang shows how a digital product can stay relevant, useful, and beautiful with steady refinement and upgrades to adapt to changing requirements over long periods of time.,Every year, Google's Web DevRel team builds and releases Santa Tracker, a holiday-themed experience for all of Dec, and which primarily features tracking Santa on the 24th. This talk will showcase some history, how we build it, interesting learnings, and where Santa is going in the future (maybe... to your house to deliver presents!).Santa is a huge single-page application built with Web Components, with heaps of historic HTMLJS, served to millions+ of users, and is going through a tricky rewrite. ,Based on an article I wrote and published on Medium, I would like to describe and demonstrate my work on building a digital, browser based replica of a Tape Delay Feedback System; all written in JavaScript, using the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs.,Linus' Law states that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".  But what happens when those eyeballs don't know what to look for?  Akin to a chain being only as strong as the weakest link, a development team is only as effective as their weakest reviewer. We've all had less than ideal reviews on our code.  Some reviewers only focus on nitpicking formatting and syntax.  Others will point out problems without any explanation or suggested alternatives.  And of course, we all know that one developer who will always give a good to go, regardless of the quality of the code.   In this talk, we will collectively perform a code review together.   Moving beyond easy to catch nits around as formatting nits and variable naming, we will take a rigorous look to understand how the code can be improved on a deeper level.  We will analyze the tests to ensure that they are sufficient while looking for ways to improve their quality, look for opportunities to refactor, and scan for edge cases and logical errors.  While doing all of this, we will manners in which to effectively communicate questions and feedback.,For the last decade we've been fighting the use of script tags, bundling our code to reduce the number of assets we need to download from the server, hoping all the while to avoid the dreaded limit of 6 simultaneous downloads from a single domain. But times have changed and with the widespread adoption of HTTP2 and native ES6 browser modules it's time we re-embraced our script tags, load all our source files individually giving us the freedom to cast off those fragile front end build systems and really leverage browser caching to it's fullest.,My talk evolved a little bit. Still mostly the same idea... just less about pseudo elements and more about handling iconography in UI., I will give an introduction to Deno httpsdeno.land,GLSL is a shader language that can send instructions to the graphics card. It is a performant way to render 3D graphics and primitive shapes and you can even run it in a browser via WebGL! This talk will teach folks how to read GLSL so they can copy and paste the relevant parts for their WebGL projects., Unleash the power of pseudo elements to build complex UI without relying on images or JavaScript. Content will be similar to this CSS Tricks post, but updated for 2018 httpscss-tricks.compseudo-element-roundup,The JavaScript ecosystem, _e.g._ the language itself, libraries, packages, frameworks, etc, seem to evolve at a lightning pace. It’s practically impossible to stay up to date on every single new feature, and it seems like there’s a new hot framework or library every few months, _e.g._ TypeScript, MobX, Next.js, Prisma, Hooks, Suspense, etc. This talk’s thesis is that you don’t actually have to stay up to date. On the other hand, the goal isn’t to become front-end ostriches, _i.e._ bury our heads in the sand and ignore every new feature. Rather, we can try to cultivate a balanced approach to continuously learning about the ecosystem, and thoughtfully adopting specific features.I'll share the system I’ve developed to determine what’s worth learning at a surface level, and what is worth learning deeply; resources to actually learn a topic; and how to play catch up when needed. I’ll also talk briefly about strategies for adopting newer features in production codebases at work.,  SpaceCraft is an open-source, real-time, collaborative REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) that allows users to write and execute code in the browser. Currently supported languages are Ruby, JavaScript, and Python.The goal of this project is to provide a tool which developers can use to easily experiment with a programming language while removing the burden of downloading and configuring the languages on their local machine.In this talk, I will present our team's project and discuss the many challenges we faced, along with the solutions we engineered to address them. The topics my presentation will touch upon include- Multi-user collaboration on the same REPL- Client-server communication with HTTP vs. WebSockets- Pseudo-terminals- Security and containers with Docker- Reverse proxies to connect users to our application,An educational tutorial  post mortem of sorts describing the process of 3d scanning my body, turning that into a web accessible format, and then distributing myself through the npm ecosystem as the package "manny". I will also probably touch on my background in web based art and how developer tools can be used creatively.,very indebted to willman for making BrooklynJS what it is. and very excited for Justin to be an official part of things!,,we really should get this up-to-date for BrooklynJS's birthday this THU. @brianloveswords, can you take an hour to get this in order by THU so we can go through it a boroughgramming?,How can we take better care of our communities and ourselves?  Everyday, we participate in so many communities, whether it be work, family life, social circles, shared interest groups, or even just the local neighborhood coffee shop.  Our needs are filled by these interdependent bonds, and as such, taking care of ourselves and our communities is one and the same question.  This talk goes into how we can build a greater sense of belonging and ownership in our communities as a means for self-care, and what that specifically can look like in our tech communities.,The year is 1999 and DVR, a magical device that gives you the power to pause and rewind live TV, was just released. You can now get a snack, rewind, and not miss a thing. This past summer, Firefox landed the ability to record and replay tabs in Nightly, which lets you rewind in real-time and jump to console messages. I can’t wait to share it with you!,The basis is this a satire related to modern day JS. I will predominantly relate modern day problemspolitics with the ecosystem of JS. The focus will be on encapsulating how the community of JS and code can be a catalyst for global change in the politicsproblems of society in general but in a subtle way.,It all started out so innocently. I just wanted a way to easily document our new Atomic CSS library at work. But the more I thought about the docs, the more I realized I could do if I was just able to capture that naming convention in code. Over the course of two years I slowly worked on building an ecosystem of tools powered by a single config that could do everything from generating docs, to generating CSS, to filtering out old unused code and way more.This talk is about the power of naming conventions, the delightful wonder that are config files and my journey from barely knowing how to write a console.log() to kinda building a compiler, all because this idea was so juicy and so exciting that I couldn't let it go., How to make changes to a running (model of) a microservices-based architecture without breaking it (probably) and how taking care of other people's ideas is crucial to software evolution.,```We talk about community a lot in open source. Communities can make or break any open source project.There are some common traits–universal lessons that can be taken from working with open source communities–that any open source community can benefit from understanding and approaching thoughtfully.So what are common traits amongst successful–and not so successful–communities? How can you begin to apply the lessons others have learned, instead of re-inventing the wheel? Most importantly, how can you help ensure _your_ community is successful?```, A look at drilling 55 holes in my MacBook Pro just to fix the keyboard, what I learned about the global supply chain, and why you should consider metalwork as a hobby.,Fixes emoji in speaker info and stops not lining up by setting a line height.Before (Chrome)!image,In the spirit of halloween, I'll be showing the wild learningexploring process of building an electron app that simulates a cracked screen. It involves finding out how to make a fullscreen always-on-top electron app running in the background (and its limitations), attempting to figure out how to generate cracked LCD patterns (if that fails or I give up have image fallpacks), and then setting a timer so that it isn't obvious.To be clear, I haven't built it yet, I am just typing up a talk idea on the subway, but since I have a bit of free time between job interviews, I can work on this over the next week. The end result will be open source on GitHub. (PS if accepted, this is my first time I have spoken at any BoroJS meetup in NYC, and fun fact, also the first tech talk I've given outside of a _cough_ my little pony convention this year! I also live in Philly, so travel assistance would be nice.),Thoughtful UI transitions can be surprisingly difficult to implement once you want to augment or move beyond the capabilities of CSS. JavaScript libraries that seem like they might help you implement complex animations can end up revealing limitations in real-world situations.I'll focus on two React libraries that I think do a good job of lowering the barrier to entry by simplifying the process of creating advanced transitions React-Pose.,Reverts 507 (with some conflict fixing), restoring the site to "normal",What technologies could replace GraphQL in the future? How can we mix ideas from Redux and long-standing ideas from the 80s to make the better user experience for our web applications?I will show how forgotten ideas from the 80s can improve UX of simple ToDo app right now and make the Internet more accessible for next billion users., Some social commentary on the potential benefits we (as developers, designers and users) can bring to the federated Web and why for those more aligned to social communication issues may want to step in _now_.,One of the hardest challenges with working in an older codebase is dealing with invisible dependencies between components. CSS rules and event handlers are particularly notorious for this; every developer has horror stories of some seemingly innocuous stylesheet changes breaking their site, or impossibly tangled event handler spaghetti. Many of the "trendiest" libraries promise to solve these specific problems for us (e.g. CSS-in-JS, Redux, MobX). This is no coincidence, as CSS and event handlers fundamentally share the same problem they create many-to-many indirect relationships between otherwise unconnected components. Likewise, the solutions share similar properties -- they make the implicit relationships explicit, and prevent common causes of conflict.This talk is a literal horror story a tale of "refactoring" a haunted house filled with spirits who behave like JavaScript event handlers, and the mayhem that ensues when their order is disturbed. I discover the "spells" that have conjured these ghosts, and realize that they are not malevolent, per se; much like some CSS rules and event handlers, they just respond poorly to changes in their environment. In the process of taming these ghosts, I discuss the theory of indirection and its problems outlined above, and how I can uses the principles espoused by trendy javascript libraries to live in harmony with my spectral companions.,Hello, I noticed the link to the EmpireJS website was broken; it was linking to ,Take all the stuff away and tell people we won't be doing our thing this month,With thi.ngumbrella, it's as beautiful as it is terse and functional. In this talk we'll compare a few example apps with current approaches in frontend development. We'll talk about hiccup vs jsx, async await & resolving promises.Side-note I'm not some promoter, just a fan of his amazing work.,For most web applications, Internet access is taken for granted. Of course, this means that when applications lose their connection, they lose almost all functionality and user experience."Offline-first" or "offline-ready" is a paradigm that seeks to maintain functionality for applications, even when clients are offline for extended periods.The primary challenge is storing data on clients, particularly for applications that feature lots of data and collaboration between users. Data changes have to be synchronized between clients and a remote server, and conflicts have to be resolved.More specifically, this talk will cover- In-browser options for persistent data storage- Writing a Promise-based wrapper to work with the asynchronous IndexedDB API- Tracking JSON document changes in a tree data structure- Synchronizing database changes to a MongoDB backend over HTTP- How to handle conflicting changes between users- Using existing libraries to make your applications offline-firstThroughout the talk, I will draw on my experience working on turtleDB, an offline-first framework written in JS, to discuss these challenges.I have a slide presentation ready and can email on request.,In this talk I walk through how I made this interactive article, The D-I-Y Data of Fugazi this would be a topic of interest, and I'm happy to tailor to what the bk.js audience will find most interesting.,There are a lot of WebAssembly guides focused on writing libraries in some language Not Javascript] and ending up with a bundle of JavaScript that you can call from your browser or Node and it just works and you might never know WebAssembly was involved unless you peeked at the source files. While this is actual literal magic, it leaves a lot unexplained, and this mystery left me hesitant to try WebAssembly until I figured out what the magic compilers were doing and why.This talk is about the boundary region between a blob of WebAssembly bytecode and the Javascript environment that calls it. Specifically a quick summary of WABT, the web assembly binary toolkit how WebAssembly exports functions for Javascript to call how WebAssembly imports and calls foreign functions what data WebAssembly can and can't represent what data can be shared across WebAssembly and Javascript environments how to represent complex structs in allocated memory how to deal with strings an example that wraps all of that ^^ togetherIn other words, I'm going to talk about all the glue code that a programmer needs to implement for WebAssembly to be conveniently usable, which should help explain what the magic bundlers are doing behind the scenes.,For teams that deliver code for the web, android, and iOS, we want to avoid writing all of our logic three times, in three different languages, across three different platforms. We will share how our team was successful in developing features of our platform that realized 70% business logic code re-use between web and mobile and even more re-use between Android and iOS. We will discuss the motivations for when it is right to code-share, how to organize your React and React-Native code and build configurations to accomplish code sharing, and how we approach integrating React components into native Android and iOS app.,Have you ever been in a situation where you didn’t ask a tech question at work because you were scared people would think it was dumb? In this talk we’ll examine how many of us may hold an unhealthy idea of what the perfect developer is and how this ideas can cause us to devalue ourselves and hinder our abilities to perform our jobs. We’ll explore together how we can foster a culture of psychological safety that can lead to healthier team dynamics and more productivity.,Every day, many of us get together with our teammates and talk about what we did yesterday and what we're doing today. If you're in a standup, there's a good chance, you're waiting on your turn to talk, tuning out other people, and trying to actually remember what you did yesterday. These 10 minutes can make or break your day. And with a few added techniques, you can start looking forward to your standup as much as you look forward to your first cup of coffee of the day.This talk will cover the intention behind the daily standup, ways to ensure you're communicating well with your teammates, and wacky ideas to get the rest of your team connecting better in your standup., While WebRTC has been around for a few years, most people only know it as technology that powers voice or video chat, or _maybe_ something seen once in a file transfer demo. But it turns out it's also a great technology for building multiplayer networked browser games, without involving a central server!This talk includes a _very_ quick introduction to what WebRTC is, some code snippets showing how to establish peer to peer data connections, a very small proof of concept demo, and then a larger demo of a work in progress game (currently online at ,Machine learning algorithms can infer gender when translating from gender neutral languages to english due to bias in training data.Hardware designed to control airbag release have resulted in the deaths of Short-stature drivers and children passengers due to bias.An engineer from Volkswagen was recently sentenced to a 40 month prison term for their part in producing software that cheated at emissions tests for diesel automobiles.You are responsible for the software and hardware you help to create. Ethically responsible, and potentially legally responsible. Through an examination of academic literature and case studies this talk will discuss the types of bias that can enter into the systems that we manufacture, and suggest ways that we can avoid bias to create better user experiences (and avoid jail time)., This talk walks through Chrome's Lighthouse performance monitoring tool, and how it applies to React apps. Lighthouse scores are a great proxy for user experience, high scores mean users see “fast” and low scores mean users see “slow”. We'll dissect reports for a few apps, explain how to tackle each recommendation in a React world, and talk about how to reach the golden 90+ score for maximal user delight.,"Decentralized file storage systems solve multiple problems inherent in a centralized storage service, related to data security, data privacy, user anonymity, and even data availability.With great interest in p2p decentralized systems such as Storj, IPFS, and Sia, a team of three developers built Layr a decentralized file storage system built atop the Kademlia DHT that enforces data retrievability and provides a cryptocurrency-based incentive.This talk covers the following1. A comparison of the core principles of decentralized and centralized systems.2. An explanation of the core challenges encountered in decentralized systems related to- Efficient peer lookup and routing- Efficiently distributing data loads- Ensuring cooperation without central authorities with incentives- How incentive-based transactions can be engineered with smart contracts- Ensuring data integrity and availability in a network of untrusted peers- And how these become more difficult when you can't trust peers to be regularly connected, non-malicious, or even in possession of powerful devices and high bandwidth.3. A walkthrough of the iterative development process of Layr, in which I describe- How we went from an extremely simple proof of concept prototype to a sophisticated network of nodes- Why data integrity is a problem and how we solved it- Why privacy is a problem and how we solved it- Why cooperation is a problem and how we solved it- Why large files are a problem and how we solved it,This PR removes Jenn from "Find an Event Staff" list on CoC page.Thank you Jenn for helping us keep great community for the past 2.5 years🙏, In GitHub our JavaScript team thinks about "what more can we do without JavaScript" a lot. We strive to use as little JavaScript as possible so we can make sure the JavaScript we do _need_ performs the best. This is where `<details>` comes in. In this talk I'll cover how we came to start using `<details>` from HTML 5.1, what we use `<details>` for, and how with just a few tricks `<details>` can be very powerful.,,Ready to take your hip hop career to the next level and simultaneously apply some of those JavaScript skills at the same time?  Using a little mixture of markov chains, basic music theory and JavaScript you can let your computer generate some beats and grooves for all of your sick verses.In this talk, I'd like to bring some of the concepts I've written a few blog posts about into JavaScript and expand on how they can be done perhaps in even a live coding context without too many lines of code required.,The Super Nintendo is humanity's greatest video game console, an accomplishment achieved by being the only system worthy of playing the greatest video game of all time, Earthbound. In this talk, I'd like to go over a project I've been working on for a couple of years, Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS, which reads SNES cartridge data and generates content in a `canvas`. ,There might come a point where you look (back) and you realize you are a maintainer.There might also be a point where you look beyond the project to understand it's place within the ecosystem.Let's explore viewing a project not just as infrastructure for a specific app or company but it's role in the language, ecosystem, and open source itself.,What comes after the keyboard and the mouse? More advanced interfaces that allow more effective communication between human and machines, specifically those that tap into the brain. So, let's plug in the human brain to the browser and build a better web. The human body is an ocean of electricity. Billions of neurons are constantly engaging as our thoughts go from one state to the next. Come see how we can tap into this data generated by human cells in JavaScript, and how to get started in the NeuroTech community. ,Module bundlers! Package managers! Superscripts! Polyfills! Frameworks galore! A multitude of JavaScript-based frameworks and tools make up the “JavaScript ecosystem”. This talk groups the tools into a taxonomy, based on what problem each tool is trying to solve and the tool's approach to solving the problem. Armed with this map of the JS ecosystem, front-end enthusiasts of all levels should be less overwhelmed by the ever-expanding landscape of modern front-end development.,An empathetic and effective interview process impacts not only the growth of an organization, but also its health, diversity, and the values that its members come to adopt as their operating principles. Yet the industry is rife with interview practices that are remnants of an older time--frameworks that are seldom effective, usually exclusionary to minorities (or those with a non-traditional background), but have somehow become the norm.In this talk, I'll first explore some common technical interview practices that are ineffective and exclusionary. Then, by stepping through the interview process, I'll give you actionable advice on how to adapt and improve your technical interviews at each stage.,I founded a company called @TokenTax being a product designer and wound up being the most technical one of the founders (I'm okay but meh). I'll walk the audience through going from 0 to building a tech company in two months or less. I'll talk about how we managed to stay afloat, how we managed to hire great people, and how we managed to scale to meet the demand.,First, the website for this meetup is awesome.Second, I just noticed this!image since this is not a custom domain., This is one of those CSS features that always seemed like it would be great to have in the year 3000. Turns out the year 3000 is now. CSS Custom Properties are available now and have been for some time. They aren't variables as you're used to, they're their own thing. And they're somethin' else. In this talk we'll look at what they are, what they aren't, day-to-day usage examples, how to feature detect for them, and wrap up with a future-facing, super neato example. This talk will be light on JS, but heavy on way cool CSS.,Privacy is coming to the forefront of national conversation (again) and many non-EU sites are discovering late in the game they need to comply with the EU privacy laws like the GDPR - or block all EU traffic. California is pondering similar laws, Canada might follow Europe’s approach and the ad industry scrambles to adapt.We are all responsible for the state of internet privacy. Whether you are adding “_that one line of JavaScript_” as requested by the marketing team, or the Instagram embed in your article. We are allowing our visitors (which includes us too) to be tracked across the internet in ways we don’t know about or very often can’t explain.This talk will have code, approaches, strategies, and simple low level ways in which we as developers can ethically and actively minimize and stop the exploitation of our users.,The browser’s capabilities have snuck up on us over the years, and it’s turned into a full blown operating system! "But wait," I hear you protest, "it’s not like the browser can talk to stuff I have plugged in to my USB ports!". Ah! But it can!The new WebUSB spec has arrived, and is already supported in at least one browser today. The previous hacks of connecting browsers to robots and other hardware will soon be a thing of the past. WebUSB as a first class API citizen opens up some great opportunities to create new and delightful experiences with robotics.I’ll introduce you to the WebUSB API, its history, and compare it to previous ’hacks’ to demonstrate why this is such a big deal for you, as a web developer. There will be hardware shown ~IRL~ ready to inspire you to think outside of the box of what browsers are really meant to be used for.,"Decentralized file storage systems solve multiple problems inherent in a centralized storage service. ly, a decentralized system does not take for granted that a data host is inherently trustworthy, available, or resistant to failure.With great interest in p2p decentralized systems such as Storj, IPFS, and Sia, a team of three developers took a month and a half to build Layr a decentralized file storage system built atop the Kademlia DHT that enforces data retrievability and provides a cryptocurrency-based incentive.In the course of building Layr, we encountered many technical and system-design challenges. For example, how does a decentralized system logically distribute and locate files? How does a decentralized system decouple file retrievability from failures on the part of the node hosting that file? How does a decentralized system detect and respond to data loss or corruption to maintain the file's retrievability? How do we provide incentive to encourage ethical behavior of all parties involved? How do we do all of this in a no-trust environment? In this presentation you will learn how we used techniques such as file sharding, proofs of retrievability, cryptocurrency-based transactions and contracts, and extending the Kademlia protocol to solve some of those problems.,Ever written an end-to-end test for a website? It’s hard! The current go-to tool for these tests is Selenium. It lets you issue commands to your browser to automate any actions a user might take - which is awesome! Unfortunately, it’s not the most robust system. Selenium tests can be extremely flakey, slow, and hard to debug. But now there’s a new kid on the block Cypress! It’s an open source tool that takes a different approach in hopes of making end-to-end testing faster, friendlier, and more reliable. In this talk, I’ll dive deeper into the differences between Cypress and Selenium, such as time travel debugging, live reloading, and automatic waiting. Through this exploration, I hope to show off how fun and easy end to end testing can be! 😍, I write crosswords for the New York Times. But crossword software sucks. It's clumsy, slow, and expensive. So I taught myself JS and built Phil, the World's Best Crossword Maker, in 8 weeks. It's fast, fun and free. This is how I did it.(Topics JavaScript, WebAssembly, Python, Google, web scraping, data analysis, SAT solvers, logic), This roller-coaster ride through the WebGL pipeline teaches you everything you'll need to know to venture beyond the boring "hello, world" of points and triangles, into bountiful and beautifully illuminated worlds. Along the way you'll discover the wondrous new features of WebGL2 that will likely unlock your secret desires to explore... the third dimension.,If I move a `<Headline >` into a `<Panel >`, I expect it's font size to adjust. If I move a `<CallToAction >` into a different section on a marketing site, I expect it's colors to adjust. That's always been cumbersome in React, requiring the developer to thread through styles.No more! Chameleon JS is a set of tools that allows you to build components that style themselves. Components are styled with the help of a style context, and that style context is updated using a style reducer. The result when you move a `<Button >` into a `<Panel >`, the context it receives changes, and it knows to style itself differently. You can focus on only writing business logic - never write styles again.I'd love to share this library that I'm working on ),  When I set out to build a game in JavaScript, I expected that I might learn a few new things about browser APIs. Instead I learned how to create my own game engine in React and develop a framework for choosing new libraries, all while having fun creating an immersive game.,Creating legible, effective, and performant visualizations of large datasets is notoriously difficult in both design and implementation. Yet in an increasingly data-driven world, visualization practitioners frequently need to tackle this challenge. As the data scales, designers and developers must find novel methods to reduce visual complexity and optimize rendering.Recently at Datadog we were faced with the challenge of scaling our visualization of customers’ deployed infrastructure, a component of our mission-critical monitoring product. Some customers have tens of thousands of hosts reporting data, and there’s no perfect way to aggregate them in an overview. Furthermore, browser rendering technologies start to degrade when rendering tens of thousands of elements. We needed to find a solution that would scale with our customers, especially as we added support for containerized infrastructure.In this talk, I’ll recount our journey of leveraging WebGL to scale beyond what d3 and SVG could handle. The talk will be partly technical and partly design-oriented, with enough real-world lessons learned to engage any audience member. I’ll explain how to decide if WebGL rendering makes sense for your visualization, describe the pitfalls we encountered and how to overcome them, and how we ultimately found success incorporating this new and challenging technology into our large, rapidly-evolving frontend codebase., In November I started learning Esperanto on Duolingo. I wondered, could I write a Natural Language Processing script that could help teach me the language and correct my mistakes?In a talk based on my blog posts (parts 1  I will show how to build a TensorFlow model which makes realtime corrections to my typing in the browser, and found errors which I fixed on Esperanto Wikipedia.JavaScript parts scraping Wikipedia text, passing text data between the browser and the TensorFlow model on the server, building a custom text input to type Esperanto, highlight errors, and make suggested changes,Most of us have found ourselves, at some point in time, building a UI without the help of a designer. Maybe you're short-staffed at work, or you're spinning up your own personal project. Never fear! Your friendly neighborhood UX Engineer is here with some practical advice for how to leverage established patterns and libraries to build effective UIs on the web. I'll also touch on some common traps that engineers fall into when designing UIs and how to avoid them.,Finally got around to updatin’ that budget.,Decorators are powerful but sometimes misunderstood language features of JavaScript. In this session you will learn what decorators are, why they are used, and how take advantage of them in practice. We will explore the use of decorators in libraries, and how to create our own decorators.,Devs are in huge demand, and there's huge crossover between tech and pretty much all other industries. This puts us in a really lucky position to work on stuff we care about and often on products we believe in without sacrificing much pay (especially straight white men). Don't be miserable in what you do if you don't have to be.With that privilege, we also have an obligation to improve the industry for everyone. Will provide ways to do this (at work, in the community etc...),This is a talk about shitposting, programming, and love! I'll show you how to transform your images and gifs with glitter crowns and laser eyes by using some geometry and a few handy APIs. You'll leave being able to show your friends you care with artisanal pics of their faces in a ham (or other vegan options)!!brianjbrennan,Building UIs has never been easier - and with tools like React, Apollo, and GraphQL, interacting with data has never been more pleasant for front end devs. DraftJS and Redraft make managing and rendering content painless across your web and native apps, and in the editing experience within your CMS. This talk will walk you through this data flow, and show you how to share components and styles using a modern CSS-in-JS toolkit like Emotion., I will present a new mathematics library called Propel. Propel provides a GPU-backed numpy-like infrastructure for scientific computing in JavaScript. JavaScript is a fast, dynamic language which, we think, could act as an ideal workflow for scientific programmers of all sorts., Closure is used throughout JavaScript frameworks, in professional code and for interviewing. Yet the vast majority of developers do not have an intuitive under-the-hood grasp of the concept. In this talk I'll introduce the notion of the state backpack to make understanding closure effortless The talk is drawn from my Frontend masters workshop - httpsfrontendmasters.comcoursesjavascript-hard-parts,Do you like maps? I like maps, and I also like to make my own maps. I am writing software that helps more people make maps and I would love to share my progress with BrooklynJS!,Homograph Attacks ,Once upon a time, we were building a website. Through a fun confluence of design and technical goals, we wanted it to be not only responsive, but modular—we would build a bunch of different widgets that could be squished together in all kinds of crazy unforeseen ways. Media queries let you restyle your content based on the width of the browser's viewport, but for our use case that was only _part_ of the problem sometimes, a widget's "viewport" was just a slice of the browser's, which meant that the browser viewport–based queries didn't really help.Well, as the saying goes, when your problem isn't a nail but your only tool is a hammer, you might as well attack your problem with _a whole lot of hammers_. Viewport-based queries did totally solve our problem—we just had to have _enough_ of them. 😎Our progression was something like this1. Despair.2. The Really Stupid Idea of just using _a bunch_ of media queries to fake "virtual viewports" within the browser viewport.3. A terrible Ruby script that wrote some CSS.4. The discovery that no one in their right mind would implement this as a Less mixin. (I tried. I still have nightmares.)4. The world's gnarliest Sass mixin.5. Nirvana normal-looking source CSS, achieved through some custom PostCSS plugins, one of which provided a rule that was _conceptually_ equivalent to a normal media query but in practice compiled to, like, a bazillion of them.The punchline is, of course, that while all this _somehow actually worked_, we ditched it in the end because the problem it set out to solve never wound up being a real problem. And so we just replaced our fancy custom rule with normal media queries, which worked Just Fine, after all.,In the Summer of 2015, while at the Recurse Center, Can a blind user use your web app? How about a keyboard only user, or someone with color blindness or a slow 3G connection? This talk will offer practical advice for how, as developers, we can share the experiences of our users, thus allowing us to empathize with them during the development process.,,This talk will demonstrate how to use TypedArrays and the Canvas API to create pixel art and games. It covers TypedArray basics, drawing shapes and sprites, animating them, and using a collision map to facilitate user interactions. The talk will conclude by discussing how to combine the aforementioned techniques with WebWorkers using `SharedArrayBuffer`.If that’s all too much for 10mins, I can just go over my journey creating pixel8, which relies on all the stuff mentioned above space_invader ,Today a minority of educators creates the majority of educational content. That makes education narrow and specific. What if we could learn from everything? Vimsical is a tool that turns regular coding session into interactive tutorials. Under the hood it's a full-fledged version control system.Try it here,, Lambda calculus means that all computation can be done with functions. No booleans, numbers, control flow or data structures – just functions! The foundation of functional programming languages can be explained in just a couple hours… but forget that, we'll demo it live in ten minutes instead., Anyone that's developed with open source has probably been burned by a dependency issue of some sort. The time spent (minutes? hours? years?) debugging dependency-related code adds up- but it doesn't have to be like this! I'd like to discuss the ins and outs of dependency management, and how `lockfile`s give us our valuable development time back., Two years ago, we revamped our project scaffold system and, in the process, designed and built a new, lightweight build system called wsk, discuss how we thought through the design process and go over some of its features that have helped us in our projects. The build system problem is currently a plague. And while this may not be the exact solution for you, walking through our thought process may help in how you set up your workflow.,@willmanduffy to review,@willmanduffy to review,React continues to grow in popularity, especially with the release of React 16. Developers who love using React may be at a loss of how to test their React applications. In this talk we will explore how to use Enzyme to test your modern React applications. We will dive into Enzyme testing and explore how to test both the DOM and virtual DOM by using Enzyme's core methods shallow, render and mount. , This talk is about building reusable libraries and UI components that are distributed as custom elements. This talk isn't about the various standards under the "WebComponents" umbrella but instead is about what you can use today to build and distribute isolated framework independent code.,After all this time we still have not made this particular aspect of our profession much better than when I got started. Why is this?, BrooklynJS Talk SubmissionOrigami Software from ScratchI've been doing origami since I was young and recently as a hobby project I've been building origami software to discover novel approaches to origami design. I'll bring some origami that was designed using code and we can chat about 2D planar graph geometry and why software tools can be useful to origami artists.Robby Krafttwitter.comrobbykraftSure! I'll be in town Nov, Dec, January, all 3 of those are good!, The idea of this talk is to briefly discuss the best ideas React has brought to the table in my opinion. I've seen quite a few talks on the technical aspects of different features the library offers but I want to analyze the outcome of the ideas and how we can benefit from them while working on user interfaces. The component API, the virtual DOM, great abstraction to favor composition over inheritance, great first contact with functional programming and so forth.,Using code to design and fabricate furniture.httpsmedium.com@olapdesigndesign-for-a-rocking-chair-8a1a1e109d7f, I write crosswords for the New York Times. But crossword software sucks. It's clumsy, slow, and expensive. So I taught myself JS and built Phil, the World's Best Crossword Maker, in 8 weeks. It's fast, fun and free. This is how I did it. (Topics JavaScript, WebAssembly, Python, Google, web scraping, data analysis, SAT solvers, logic),definitely doing this right on time and not at all late @willmanduffy to review, We have all dealt with bad code written in a library or framework that doesn't suit our needs. It's hard to have the time to do a full rewrite. So how do we migrate to better libraries like Redux or React? confetti_ball Dongles confetti_ball ! I'll share strategies for writing code to inter-operate between your legacy code and new code. After this talk, you'll be ready to build more dongles than Apple would know what to do with. , What is the Debian project? Why does it matter? How does Debian package and distribute Javascript code? And why are its policies so seemingly outdated and opaque? In this talk, I'll introduce the audience to Debian and the Debian Javascript team, share some of the history and challenges of the team, and invite community members to get involved with the project., Introduction of an alternate approach to building web applications that seamlessly blend client and server-side development. By introducing asynchronous abstractions over browser APIs and node modules, Mobius is able to execute code in lock-step across multiple machines and simplify the process of building complex applications. We'll take a brief tour through compilers, determinism, network protocols, server-side rendering, security and reactive programming as we tear down the clientserver wall. , Using AWS Lambda functions as the backend for distributed jobs. Hivemind is a library that leverages AWS Lambda functions so you can process or gather data quicker than you can locally at an incredibly low cost., Recently I’ve been working on a cool file uploading widget for the browser called Uppy as a lightweight view library for our user interface. What else is out there? Briefly on `Hyperx` vs `JSX`, `Preact` and `Hyperapp`; The Golden Retriever plugin — how we are using `Service Worker` and `IndexedDB` to make uploads survive browser crashes; Redux without Redux; Building the user interface with plugins and extensibility in mind; Open source early on bonuses and challenges that come with it;, What are monads? Are they useful? And most interestingly, why do some people care so much, and other people care so little? We'll answer these questions by comparing monads to another everyday concept, the brapple., We're living the halcyon days of tiny computers and JavaScript, but MIDI is a technology that's been around for much longer. In this talk we'll explore why it's implementation and prevalence in hardware makes for a uniquely intriguing and accessible platform for creative coding.Tiny computers such as the RaspberryPi! Sitting at convergence of these two things is MIDI — a niche protocol that's been around since 1983 and was originally designed for musical instruments to communicate with one another. It's event-oriented approach to messaging feels right at home in the asynchronous world of JavaScript & Node, and the prevalence of MIDI support in older musical equipment means you can find unique, hackable and affordable hardware at your local pawnshop or Craig's List.This unlikely tech stack — Tiny Computers + JavaScript + MIDI — can lend itself to creative programming beyond music. George's Talk will explain how to get started, walk through several examples and elaborate on the future of this stack, not only as a platform for experimentation but for education as well.,To grow our technical leadership skills, it’s critical to lean on one’s network of support. We often find mentors people who can give us helpful advice. But what can be even more valuable is finding “sponsors”, who help us find new opportunities and improve the visibility of our work. As sponsorship is especially important for members of underrepresented groups in tech, we’ll walk through tactics you can employ today to be a sponsor for those around you, too.,If you've ever watched a movie or played a video game where there were 3D characters that moved around, you've seen skeletal animation!But.. how does it work?A lack of beginner resources on the web will have you thinking that it's black magic, but it turns out that there are only two key concepts at playA skin and some bones.In this talk we'll learn how skeletal animation works by talking through some WebGL and JavaScript powered interactive slides that I'll make for BrooklynJS. We'll render a skeletally animated character and some other helper visuals and dive into what's going on (explained at a beginner level).You'll walk away with- A better understand of how it all works because you've gotten a combo of interactive visuals and me describing said visuals with no background knowledge assumed.- A GitHub link to the source code powering the interactive slides  the skeletal animation implementation & visuals- A sense of where to find more resources to keep the ball rolling after this 10 minute introduction of skeletal animation,Fix header on brooklynjs.comcocbefore!screen shot 2017-09-08 at 4 55 56 pm, Mindful communication means to listen and speak with compassion, kindness and awareness. This is easier said than done, so this talk provides examples of how to apply mindful communication to reviewing code.,@willmanduffy to review,Not all systems allow the code to take over the entire rendering of your app. Sometimes you want to modernize and scale your code using libraries such as React on systems that already have a lot of legacy interactive code, or a CMS that must controls what is rendered in the page.This talk shows techniques to adapt an existing environment so modern libraries can coexist with existing environments, where the DOM dictates the components it needs.,A crash course on subtractive synthesis with the goal of creating a web-based synthesizer that can only play the Stranger Things theme song repeatedly. We'll explore the fundamentals of sound and dive deep into what those cool vintage synthesizers are actually up to behind the scenes, all with some neat visualizations and cool noises.,Star Trek's communicators and tricorders are often cited as the inspirations for the modern smartphone, but no science fiction has inspired me as deeply as Cher's closet in Clueless. In this talk, we'll build a web app to put together cute, coordinated outfits, and along the way we'll learn a little bit about constraint solvers, relational databases, and the history of artificial intelligence.,In 2015, I decided to take a picture of everything I ate. Every sandwich, every chip, and every square of chocolate. For 365 days, if I ate it, I took a picture of it. When December rolled around, I had over 1,800 pictures with nowhere to put them. I couldn’t upload that many photos to Facebook or Instagram, and I hadn’t found a photo service that I liked enough to put my food photos on.So I built a website., an image grid that is faster, more responsive, and easier to use than any other solution I could find. It's heavily influenced by the Google Photos image grid, and this talk explains how it works.,What can we learn from history to help us become better developers? The Universal Design movement, popular in 🏠 architecture 🏠  in the late 60's and early 70's, continues to inform some of the best designs across industries to this day. I'll go over how we can borrow from the Universal Design movement to write clean code that works for everyone. I'll also go over some basic concepts of accessibility and why every application should keep accessibility in mind!,Google Cloud Platform is an amazing tool chalk-full of features, but can be a bit intimidating at first glance. This talk will walk through some of the tools provided by GCP with the time tested strategy employed by the coolest frameworks the TODO list app.   Will cover  - deploying a node app to app-engine, versioning and debugging- persisting data with DataStore and how to manage it- using DataStore in your node app- helpful `gcloud` commands (create-todo-app is not one of them, I made that up), After it's time in the sun, React has been more of a fatigue with 16+ versions. We discuss the similarities, differences and benefits of this lightweight framework and why it deserves the praise. Justin is an UI Engineer who's worked with javascript in his tool belt since the early 2000's.  ,GraphQL is an interesting way of implementing API endpoints. In this talk, I will introduce GraphQL, show what does and what it does not do, with lots of live examples.,Screencap from ScriptEd donation!image@willmanduffy to review,Many developers and tech workers sign employment agreements with their employers that include broad restrictions on their ability to contribute to FOSS projects — whether as part of their employment, after hours, or both. ContractPatch is an initiative to give digital laborers the words they need to make sure they can continue the work that’s important to them and to our community. Whether those words are negotiation tactics in the hiring process, or language to suggest for a prospective employment agreement, ContractPatch aims to help developers defend their own interests and property rights.Negotiating a contract is a skill like any other. ContractPatch aims to give developers access to the soft skills and hard contract clause language necessary for effectively asserting your rights as a digital laborer.,I will detail how The New York Times emerged from the ashes of PHP, built a new and beautiful CMS, found itself in a sea of React components, crafted a weird AF responsive grid in scss and JavaScript (that works in IE11), and built a system that allows designers and programmers to work on something once and reuse it wherever and whenever the hell they want to! ^),Every ten years, everyone in the US is counted by the Census, and our congressional districts get redrawn. In 2020 it will be different manipulating the district maps, known as gerrymandering, is now done with algorithms and "big data" collected on every voter.  A recent study,My talk is about making an art with machine learning. I'll talk about the some concepts discussed in machine learning code implementations (like perceptrons!), as well as how and WHY we would do this in JavaScript. I'll end my talk with a demo of a JavaScript app that looks at a photo and tries to recreate it creatively.Note This talk is modified from the last section of my Nordic.Js and JSConf Iceland talk, Create Art With Javascript,Coding is a language like any other language and a great tool for communicating. I love the creativity and problem solving aspect of technology, which helps you to become a better critical thinker.Knowledge is power and technology is the tool for this empowerment. That’s what made me  become a citizen of the world without considering geographical boundaries. I founded Code to Inspire as the first coding school for girls in Afghanistan and made everything happens in Herat, Afghanistan literally online, starting from the fundraiser, shipping equipments, recruiting mentors, registering applicants, curriculum development and etc. This is the power and connectivity I am talking about which enabled a refugee born who was deprived to access education makes her dream come true and give free access of technical and digital literacy to her hometown women!,JavaScript is often derided for callback hell and for quirks around equality, number handling, type coercions and the "this" keyword. This is largely a straw man argument. Developers work around these shortcomings through conventions, tools, and libraries and the problems caused by these kinds of quirks come up infrequently. This talk instead aims to explore the best ways that I know how to write JavaScript- using good conventions, using functional libraries, using types, using promises and immutable data- and motivate PureScript as a way of pushing the limits and bringing development in the JavaScript ecosystem to the next level.,We all encounter setbacks. Whether we are victims of circumstance or unintentionally cause ourselves harm, facing consequences is something common to us all. Sometimes we're able to bounce back. Sometimes, our setbacks our permanent and what was once certain is no longer.Last year, I suffered a deeply personal loss for which I was completely unprepared. In the aftermath, I almost left the tech industry altogether. But I got help and now I've returned; I'm coding again and I've learned a great deal about carrying on with the scars I've suffered. I'd like to talk about my loss and share three of things I've learned in a way I hope will be beneficial to all.This is not a technical talk; it is accessible and applicable to all skill levels as I wish to connect with the audience on a more personal level. This talk is not even about JavaScript. However, it a story of a developer's mental health, a topic relevant to everyone in the JS community, and I hope may serve as a thought-provoking departure from the norm.,We asked _What if everything was a tutorial?_ How much more could we learn if the knowledge of how we make things was just a click away? That's Vimsical. A highly granular process control system that integrates with your tools and automatically records your process, and a platform to share not just the result of your work, but the journey that led up to it.We wrote the entire app in 3 months, as a team of 2 people, in Clojure(-Script)., This past December, I decided to take my remaining vacation days (5) and see if I could learn enough react native to be reasonably productive in that time. Since then, using what I learned, I've been able to give two talks on React Native and to be pretty productive on a React Native side project. In this talk, I want to talk about learning, and how to learn, by demonstrating some of the techniques I used. I've used the same ones for almost every new framework I've come across in JS. These include- deep work (how do you change your environment and your habits to maximize for success)- mind map (use this tool to test what you know to begin with, and make your learning easier by starting at the edges of your current understanding -- includes graphical diagrams)- finding the best resources- take better notes and organize your thoughts when you discover these resources- using spaced repetition and koans to practice concepts- picking a sample project- ??- profit, Remember spreadsheets? They're awesome! In this talk we'll go over tools and ways to use spreadsheets for good and for giggles., In Javascript, especially the land of React, there are plenty of wrong ways to do, well, anything. But many times, there's not one "right way" to go about doing it... it's all shades of gray. I'll talk about a few common cases of analysis paralysis and how to get over it., 🚨  NEW PROJECT KLAXON 🚨 I've been working for the last few months on a project called Svelte, and our tool of choice translates that into a series of DOM updates. That's great for developer happiness but there are some significant trade-offs. Svelte changes all that by compiling your declarative components into JavaScript that resembles the targeted DOM manipulation code you'd write yourself — in other words, doing the hard work once at build time instead of n times at run time.There's loads of different aspects I could focus on your app gets much smaller, because you no longer need to ship a virtual DOM differdata binding systemvirtual machinewhatever your app gets much faster, because the compiler can aggressively optimize — no need to do complex diffing operations etc your app is easier on the garbage collector, because you're not generating a new copy of your entire view on every state change. Svelte uses less memory than any other framework, which is great for mobile your codebase is regret-proof — because there's no real runtime framework to speak of, you never have to worry about shipping two frameworks simultaneously if you decide to adopt a new tool in future because components are self-contained, it completely changes the game when it comes to interoperability. Web components finally make sense! SSR is a crazy amount faster — you just tell the compiler to output a string-generating function instead of a DOM-generating one the developer experience is beautiful. For example you can write normal CSS and it will be encapsulatedstatically analysed etc simplicityminimalism versus powerfeatures is revealed to be a false dichotomy,Building applications in the "modern age" requires acknowledgement and acceptance of paradigm shifts in many facets of a company's operations, and while resources are focused on tooling and technology, one critical component — the developer experience —  is often overlooked. Failure to see digital transformation as organizational and cultural change often means the transformation itself fails, not to mention the impact it has on developer morale, engagement, productivity and ultimately retention. In this talk I will talk about cultivating a developer experience that values training, knowledge transfer, educational support and professional development to fuel digital transformation, yield better products and build stronger technical teams. ,Hot off the tails of a successful presentation at dinosaur js this abridged version of "The cost of unmoderated collaboration" gets into the nitty gritty of why it is so important to have clear moderation rules in your community. It presents hard learned lessons from Node.js as well as some best practices for you to take home.,GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW I WAS WRONG TO HATE FEATURE FLAGS BACK IN THE DAY AND HOW THEY CAN DECOUPLE ROLLOUT FROM DEPLOYMENT., Deploying applications has never been easier and as a result more and more developers are doing it themselves. The rise of containers have made it simple to scale and manage entire ecosystems. We'll go over what a container is and how to completely package your node application into one. After that i'll be doing a demonstration on running that container using Kubernetes! ,we can tweak this later, but this is just to bring this letter up to present reality now that the bench project has completed here.,website has 815-830-900-845-800now 800-815-830-900, One day we woke up and things were different. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning powering swarms of cloud containers talking to browsers running apps originally written in C++, now compiled to JS. Augmented and Virtual Reality are happening in your browser! Join Scott Hanselman as he explores the relationship between the Cloud and the Browser, many Languages and one Language, how it might all fit together and what might come next in this upbeat and edutaining talk. How many animated gifs of Neil Patrick Harris can one man use in one technical talk? Let's find out!", TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript maintained by Microsoft. It's gained hugely in popularity over the past 2-3 years, largely because Microsoft has taken a "Switzerland" approach to JS they try to support all the frameworks and all the workflows. I'll talk about why you might want to use TypeScript, how to migrate a JavaScript project to TypeScript, and some exciting new features that have been added in the past year which help TS faithfully model JS code that was previously hard to statically type.These posts I've written about TypeScript are along the lines of what I'll talk about- A Typed pluck exploring TypeScript 2.1’s mapped types,1] (Medium)- A typed chain exploring the limits of TypeScript,2] (Medium)- Why and when to use TypeScript,3] (StackOverflow Documentation)Seeing TypeScript in action is the most compelling argument for using it, so I hope to show lots of examples in vscode during my talk.,Let's blast through some live coding and build out CRUD APIs in Node.js together. In moments, based on our data model, we can quickly have RESTful endpoints with all the verbs one could possibly need. That willman literally take me 73 seconds, as you'll see in the 1920s video below before they had audio. The rest of the time, we could hook up a legit datasource, slap in some ACLs, maybe even develop some relationships between our models. If there be hecklers, we'll _develop_ some relationships there too. It'll be fun!!Rapid APIs in LoopBack,This talk is shwowing how programming is more magical then what is it one focus language will be JavaScript and how I first encountered the language and how I interact with it now. Showing some good videos of before and after learning javascriptprogramming , Looking at where science has gone wrong in the past, and how to avoid making the same mistakes on the web.,With a modern web development approach is there even a need for servers? I answer that question by exploring the implementation of into my front end web app that lets me know if there is a baseball game and when to avoid public transit. I explain the benefits of my server-less project, which includes speed, cost, and security. By the end of this talk, you will have a good understanding to build a fast, secure front-end that talks to a low-cost server-less architecture. You will also find out if there is a baseball game the night of the talk as well 😉,I launched oTranscribe.com in October 2013 while still getting to grips with JavaScript. Almost four years on, it has approximately 90,000 monthly users — and that number is growing every month by word of mouth alone. Meanwhile, I have an unrelated full-time job and still host it on GitHub Pages.In this talk, I’ll discuss my unsuccessful attempt at rewriting oTranscribe from scratch, what I learnt in a (more successful) refactor, and more generally what it means to have your open-source project blow up beyond your wildest dreams.,What does my data sound like? A lighthearted exploration of musical composition through the humble JS object. , Hindley-Milner type signatures are easy to write and easy to read. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find a simple introduction to the Hindley-Milner system. Much writing on the topic (1 by the Ramda](I aim to leave the audience able to read Hindley-Milner type signatures and perhaps persuaded that this system provides a lightweight compliment to more comprehensive documentation systems such as JSDoc.,~~~ THE MOST PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE PULL REQUEST IN BROOKLYNJS HISTORY ~~~, Coding is hard.  Even harder when you can't just search StackOverflow for an answer.  Here are a few issues that were incredibly small but ate up ridiculous amounts of time while working with the google-react-maps and react-bootstrap.1. Size Matters  The div box needs to be greater than 0.  This is great, unless you're using react-bootstrap.  Then you've got flex containers that are 0 because it's waiting on google-react-maps, which is waiting for react-bootstrap, which is waiting for . . . . .2. Custom Icons and SVG attributes  google-react-maps is great for more customization.  Unfortunately, there's a large learning curve to get to that point.  Here I figured out how to use custom SVG icons and pass them into the component.  We'll also look at some attributes of SVG that allow you to customize size, offsets, and more., The concept of “element” or “container” queries has enjoyed universal support among front-end developers for years, but a standard solution hasn’t even been spec’d yet, never mind implemented in browsers. There are good reasons for that, which we’ll explore first-hand by rolling up our sleeves and attempting to be the Extensible Web Manifesto that we want to see in the world – with ResizeObserver.,After the past election, a group of developers and designers got together to build a Facebook Messenger app to help connect constituents with their Members of Congress. After a few months of process and development, CallParty was born. Using JavaScript on both the client and server, CallParty provides users with their representative's information and a script to help them get their thoughts across.The talk will cover how we integrated the government data into our platform and then into Facebook Messenger, using their API., WebGL is most often used solely as the view layer, especially for 3D visualizations, but with a little magic we can have it handle all of our application logic. You'll learn how to use framebuffers to store and update state, textures to pass in user input, and a traditional WebGL presentation layer to render the result at a smooth 60 frames per second.,Everyone is excited about bot's and text based interfaces. As with any new technology the eco-system is changing rapidly and documentation isn't great.To make matters worse, most providers and libraries give examples of bot's ordering Pizza or telling team members the weather. The point of my talk is to walk through a real use case and how I shipped a Slack bot into production. As well as give some background about the different providers I tested BotKit.I had a few weeks of real pain and suffering so hopefully after this talk people can honestly say building a bot is easy!,UNIQLO had just spent a ton of cash on its first e-commerce website in the US, but it had one serious flaw half of its potential sales bounced because it was desktop-only. This is the true story of how two scrappy New York JavaScripters defied the odds to build an app that brought UNIQLO mobile., Written by @mikolalysenko is a functional wrapper for the WebGL API that's effectively rewired the way I think about drawing graphics. I use it for fun and work, so I'll talk about how I've come to realize the scope of the API hits the nail on the head and why removing state makes small experiments enjoyable and large projects maintainable. And of course I'll show off some fancy things people have done with it.I've never given a programming talk, so I'd love the opportunity to talk briefly about regl and try to pass on some great lessons I've learned from its design! Thanks for your consideration!,As a web developer, I was always jealous of the fact that native apps could send beautiful, actionable push notifications and I couldn't. But not any more! Chrome (on both desktop and Android) can receive push messages and display notifications, no matter if the original page is open or not.We'll go through the Push API, the Notifications API, and how we can add interactivity though tags, notification click events and notification action buttons.,We have a problem. Data. Reproducing bugs that simulate complex data requirements - such as degraded performance - can take a lot of wasted time. One workaround is `chrome-envious`, a Chrome Extension we wrote to swap out live URL requests in a running site, allowing a developer to run their local assets against a deployed environment. ,When I wrote Chart.js v2, I learned a lot of what people expect and need in a charting library.  But when attempting to achieve the same great usability in the React ecosystem, I noticed a massive whole in my heart that Chart.js could no longer completely fill.  I needed a charting library that works as easily as Chart.js (and looks just as great) but lets me take advantage of React's awesome power of composition, performance, and lifecycle. React-Charts is a data visualization library that embodies the spirit of Chart.js in a way that will make react developers swoon and sing praises to the visualization gods.I plan on releasing the library live on stage, along with presenting its capabilities and how it stacks up to the competition (objectively of course).  I am also the creatormaintainer of Jumpsuit, React-Table, and React-Form, and still help maintain Chart.js, so I would hopefully be able to instill some learned wisdom from the open source realm and what it takes to buildcontribute-to an open source library (and how rewarding it can be),As JS developers, we tend to use the terms "node" and "element" fairly interchangeably.  These are different things though (hint one is a type of the other) and they both are accessible to you.  I'll dig into why these both exist, the fun (unexpected) ways they differ, and how the things we do in our day to day work can actually be really confusing when we look closer at them!,As someone who can’t stand modern technology and can’t stop using it, I decided to be the change I wanted to see in the world. By creating technology that is flaweduselessregressivefrustratingetc, I attempt to create unexpected experiences that resist the homogenization of tech and the hegemony of the screen.This talk will cover a few of my recent physical and digital interventions and how JavaScript and I came to be., In 2013 an urban designer started a civic tech project that changed the face of urban planning forever. 3.5 years later we are still a scrappy open source project, but we built it in Node.js and JavaScript back when no one believed it could do what we're doing with it. Sure, we might have launched with a single 10,000+ line JS file instead of a module bundler and we're still on MongoDB, but in the past year we've migrated large parts of it to ES2015 and ReactRedux, and maybe we will switch to PostgreSQL? Who knows? Despite JavaScript hijinks, it turns out a ton of urban planners and local bikepedestrian mobility advocates depend on us to create change in their community. And I'm still not being paid to do any of this. Listen to me rant about that for 10 minutes.,For centuries the visual arts have been used to tell stories, warn people about dangers and invoke emotion. Today we use the internet for all those purposes and more. Just as the Vatican employed painters to spread their message – it will be the developers and designers who will lead us into the next Renaissance. But there is still a lot to learn from the great masters. In this talk, we will flexbox the Golden Ratio with Leonardo DaVinci, up the pixel ratio for our devices with the Impressionists & ”inspect elements” of some iconic works of art to make the web a more beautiful place.(aka the talk i gave at CSSConf EU earlier this month),WebAssembly is a way to run code on the web that's not JavaScript, so that your existing and future JavaScript code can be better. For example, maybe you're a bank who has a lot of C or Java code you've worked hard on to calculate mortgage rates, and you want to make that available to developers who are writing JS. Now you can -- effectively, efficiently, and compactly!In this talk, we'll discuss what WebAssembly is, how it works, and how it can team up with your JS to make your applications much more powerful.,As javascript gets better, the number of devices we use multiplies, and speed becomes more important, many companies are moving towards splitting their APIs off from their front ends. As a result, a variety of new architecture styles have emerged to attempt to tackle this new pattern, from entirely static pages to heavy client side apps to isomorphic single page app rendering.I work at an agency and have had the opportunity to experiment with a number of them across different projects, and have landed on a pattern we call "hybrid static" as the most efficient and least confusing. In this pattern, data and templates are shared between compile time and runtime, so you can decide which parts of the app are rendered as static pages or sections, and which parts are rendered dynamically at runtime. For example, if you were building a blog, you might render the first 10 posts on the first page as static html, then dynamically load the next 10 from the same API into the same template using javascript on the client side if the user goes to the next page. Webhooks allow dynamic rebuilds if data changes in the API so that static pages are always up to date.The talk would discuss this pattern in depth as well as how it can be achieved using Spike, an extension of webpack 2 made specifically for advanced static site generation.,CSS styling with React is a hot mess. Let’s discuss! OOCSS vs. BEM vs. inline CSS vs. React styled-components etc.,Many programmers consider "minimalism" to be a virtue, but few can agree on exactly what it means; should we strive for code that's simple, elegant, or efficient to compute? In this talk I'll discuss my attempts to reconcile these definitions, and how Tiny House Hunters helped me put it all together.,Snapshot testing was made recently popular by Jest, the React-friendly test tool. But hey guess what it's not just for React. Let's build a simple snapshotter so I can show you what it is, how it's different than other tests, and why it's PERFECT for functionally testing your API responses, no matter what language you use. , BrooklynJS Talk SubmissionBiohacking, Cyberpunk & You   The Future is NowThis talk goes over embedded (in you!) hardware, talks about some rad cyberpunk stuff, and then goes over Augmented Reality with JavaScriptRachel WhiteohhoeMARCH  APRIL,I will talk about two recent art projects -- an online experiment for exploring geography (httpslines.chromeexperiments.com) and an interactive public art installation for seeing your face in new ways -- that use JS under the hood.     I am pretty new to javascript so I will talk about what I learned along the way and share some of the tools I found helpful.   ,Twitch is a great place for people to watch others play games, cook food, draw, code, and much more. Some viewers are passive, but most are excited to interact with the person running the channel they're watching. Using the in-channel chat box is a great way to converse with your favourite Twitch creator, however this can sometimes feel limited and the response is often delayed. Since Twitch chat is run by IRC, we can use NodeJS to listen in the right room and do some really fun things with just a little bit of imagination. In this talk, I'll share my experiences with creating highly entertaining Twitch chat bots that augment the audience's interactions into something much more fun. Expect some laughter, a little bit of hardware, and some fuzzy feelings abound. You'll walk away inspired to explore beyond the face value of the interfaces you are familiar with., During the Olympics of Rio 2016 I created a visualization of all 5000 gold medal winners since the very first Olympic Games of 1896, called Olympic Feathers](, An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton](,This talk will use a small personal project (a simple AI) to explore the usefulness of different JavaScript compilers in meeting various project requirements. It will include a survey of several popular JavaScript compilers (Babel, Emscripten, and TypeScript in particular) with an analysis of their benefits  tradeoffs., 10x programmer. Ninja. Rock star.

This talk would be about the motivations of Yarn, what it has to offer, and an example workflow of using it in a production environment.  More specifically  - npm, Yarn... why do they both exist?- What does Yarn aim to accomplish and why should I use it?- How packages are installed through Yarn    - What is a lockfile?    - Where do my packages live?- Using Yarn inside of AWS,I've been an iOS Developer for most of my professional life, but I had a late start compared to other developers I've interacted with. I was fairly content living in England managing a team of mobile engineers, when one day, I had the good fortune of being offered the opportunity to come back to the USA to focus on Node.js full time.It was difficult to choose between broadening my horizons and my knowledge, or continuing my path of going deeper into mobile. I chose to take a leap of faith back across the ocean, embarking on an entirely new path of Node.js evangelismengineering. There have been many challenges and obstacles, as well as rewards. I'd like to share my story about how I've transitioned and what I've learned.,Before I did Javascript, I did Ruby. I've seen the hellish landscapes of godforsaken Rails applications that had been clumsily patched to within an inch of their lives.This talk will teach you how _not_ to do that.A few core tenets Never modify or delete; only add. Favor modifying the prototype of a _single object_ rather than the prototype of a core data structure. Subclass whenever possible. Poop in the middle of the floor. (All will be explained.) Patch functionally. Side effects will hurt you. Think _really hard_ before modifying `Object.prototype`. If you think you know what you're doing, think again.Thanks! Looking forward to the event!,Hello BrooklynJS!My  is Owen Buckley.Thanks for your consideration and let me know if you have any questions!,The power of diagrams as a tool for documentation and debugging is often overlooked. This talk will cover how and why to use diagrams to communicate with ourselves and others, including their value as a tool to support different learning styles.,A few of the pain points of a newbie to RxJS, discovered by using it to code a simple game.,Hi, I'm Scott Polhemus. I was an engineer on the tech team of the Clinton campaign for the last 5 months before the election. What I saw there was an insanely brilliant and diverse team of engineering and design talent brought together by a shared commitment to build something that would have a real impact on people's lives. It was a team built on trust, communication, collaboration, and love, which became all the more important when the focus shifted from developing and operating a modern campaign platform to coping with grief following the election and trying to find meaning in a confusing world.This would be my first talk. I wasn't sure about submitting this given the timing of this month's event, but I think it would be nice to take the opportunity to look back on more innocent times and share some stories of what we built on the campaign and why the people I met there give me some hope for the future.,Working talk titles1. Let's not romanticize learning to code. It's challenging mentally, emotionally and physically.2. learningToCode == learningAboutYourselfI’m a self-taught developer, and the process itself was an exercise in learning about myself. At points I was miserable, experiencing bouts of depression and angst, and quitting multiple times. Following the last time I ‘quit learning to program’ I realized there was some part of me that was self-sabotaging, and I decided to quit that instead. So I left my job, got an internship as a junior developer and have been programming full-time since. Part of my angst came from this sense that programming was somehow this innate skill I needed to have been born with, or should be able to develop effortlessly. I now feel that’s insane. But, the reality is, there are other people who think the same and the media projects this idea of learning to program  being a programmer as some sort of romance story You read an article about programming. You take an online class and you’re instantly hooked. It’s meant to be, happiness for everyone! NOPE.I feel that we should be sincere and share what the reality of learning to program is really like, regardless of your path. No one experiences it the same way, and sharing mainly the stories of those who were fortunate to excel as programmers, can set others up for failure (or make them feel like they’re failing). Let’s stop romanticizing learning to program  being a programmer - it’s hard, but worth it, if it’s the right fit for you., NYC SpaceTime DirectoryThe NYC SpaceTime Directory will make urban history accessible through the kinds of interactive, location-aware tools used to navigate modern cityscapes. It will provide a way for scholars, students, and enthusiasts to explore New York City across time periods, and to add their own knowledge and expertise. Over the past five years The New York Public Library has worked on many digitization, crowdsourcing, and digital cartography projects, all aiming to make the collection of the New York Public Library more accessible. The NYC SpaceTime Directory, a two-year project funded by the Knight Foundation, will build on top of those efforts, and it will create new connections between previously unconnected library collections and data sources, allowing people to tell new stories about the history of New York City.

I do React and Redux for work, so Im prepared to explain Elm in terms JavaScript folk understand. Im a regular at the NYC Elm meet up, and Ive done a ton of Elm projects. Ive even played around with Elm pretty deeply into its native JavaScript. I dont really want to evangelize Elm, but I would be happy to explain what its all about, how to use it, and its supposed advantages.,I'm in town on the 18th, so I thought it might be a good idea to meet some friends and speak at the event. abstractAt @nearForm, we like to scratch our own itch, and we build tools based on the needs of our customers and our own needs as consultants. @davidmarkclements and myself were in London conducting a performance training and consulting, and we noticed one notable pattern the routes that were logging more were the slowest ones. Moreover, disabling logging allowed far greater throughput. We started a quest to assess the cost of logging. In the end, we ended writing down our own logger, httpswww.npmjs.compackagepino.

Seen athttpsvimeo.com180476148httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v=zja-_IYNrFc,"Helping people" has always been my MO, but how do you do that without getting stuck in systems that perpetuate badness? In this talk, I'll take you on a journey through medicine, tech, and education to highlight how responsibly "nudging" systems in the right direction can be surprisingly effective, especially if you guide yourself with impact rather than revenue. It's an evidence-based journey, a journey I've lived, and one that speaks to one of the prime goals of most of us making a difference with the work we do.I will talk about- building a team intentionally and giving up privilege as a needed prerequisite- setting company truths and KPIs to align social impact with growth- navigating the (false!) for-profitnon-profit gauntlet- Vue.js as a frontend router for a static website (no, really. it didn't go well.)- leading from behind as a co-founder- tutors,Hydra is a new microservices library (NPM) which allows you to build NodeJS microservices using very little code.

Technical blogging is one of the easiest ways to give back to the tech community, and it was the place that I started when I was fresh graduate of a coding bootcamp and had just started my first developer job.But we all dread it for a reason blogging is intimidating. It’s hard to feel like your ideas are valid, and to actually write something without doubting your own qualifications, let alone whether anyone is actually reading anything that you write. So how do we reconcile this with the fact that blogging is one of the best ways to level up your skills?In this talk, I’ll share what I learned in my one-year project of writing a technical blog every single week. In researching and writing my series of Technical Tuesday](,Imposter syndrome is something we all get sometimes--how can we not, when we see people who eat, breathe, and live code? As a Silicon Valley native who got into programming after leaving the Valley, I've realized how Imposter Syndrome pushed me to work harder, do more, and learn more. This talk will go over what you can do to stay sane, meet cool people (including mentors), make fun projects you actually look forward to working on, how to be a mentor, and more., Amateur radio, or the ~original world wide indie web~I'd like to talk a little bit about amateur ("ham") radio the history, the physics, how it enables you to communicate and do cool technology things, and how you can get involved!Radios power nearly all wireless technology, and may be well known in the JavaScript community due to old packet radio software causing a Debian  collision with node.js.Hoping to include some fun audio and video clips radio ,The CSS Grid Layout module is expected to start shipping in all modern browsers early next year, and it won't be hiding behind vendor prefixes! So what exactly does that mean? In this talk you'll see examples of layouts previously only possible with JavaScript now made with pure CSS. I'll also introduce you to some of the basics like the new syntax (what on earth kind of unit measurement is "fr"?), how and why Grid is different than Flexbox (and how it's similar), and how it improves accessibility by separating source order from display.,Undefined is not a(n) x and other things that make people throw their computers off of bridges. As developersdesignershumans we have all dealt with tools that have a poor user experience, and make us feel bad. However there is another way; there are compilers that can kindly guide us with plain spoken error messages written in simple language, and provides us with hits toward a path forward. Using Elm (and to some extent Rust) as a case study I want to talk about new tools that focus on making the creative process of writing code better. I believe that friendly tools can go beyond their proposed ease of use, and help us write easier to use software. Tools written with empathy are in a way contagious.This](Also, I didn't escape my & because I never know when to do that.,I've realized that Engineering Management is actually kinda like Neko Atsume, with a little bit of Pokemon.

It's a Node test runner that runs your files in parallel and tests concurrently—giving very good IO performance. We also ship Babel built-in, have awesome assertion messages, and care a lot about dev experience. There's a ton of interesting technical stuff going on in AVA and its ecosystem that I can talk about.That said, AVA was the first open source project that I contributed to (I started in November). The people that run AVA were very patient, inclusive, and nice through my many pull requests that led to me contributing enough to be invited to be part of the team. I've learned a ton about empathy and helping people make contributions. There's a lot of knowledge and experiences I want to share!My talk will introduce AVA a bit from a technical standpoint but would mostly be about managing a welcoming open source community.Thanks!,Talk SummaryWe all have biases and they influence how we build products every day.

The audience can then modify the ram using a (spooky) currency to change the fate of the unsuspecting player. The main demo runs a 2 player game of Contra and lets the audience addremove lives and weapons, corrupt graphics and sound, and a few other bizarre effects we found when exploring the game. If there's time we'll run a Track & Field demo where the audience is split into teams and the contribution of the audience's taps will make each player run. The results are usually hilarious since we push the speed beyond what's possible by a controller input and the long jump gets really long (off the top of the screen and wrapping around a few times before he lands).Audience view  UI Technical details ,JavaScript code if often asynchronous and handling errors in asynchronous code is hard!

I want to talk about time and how it's garbage and how "time is a social construct" is more real than we want to believe it is. I opened this PR from my phone. The future is rad. ---No seriously, it's about time. The short  is I want to rant for 10 minutes on time and how it's a BS social construct. The long  is I want to talk about the complexities of time handling in applications.

Let's talk about how to pick the right tool for the way the job will probably go wrong.,shimming the node.js function `process.nextTick` in the browser would seem like a straight forward proposition, but when a module is popular enough there are enough corner cases to challenge straight forward assumptions like 'all functions will complete executing before other code runs' or 'you can cache a function in a local variable' fail to hold true.In this talk we'll discuss the various corner cases, solutions, and mistaken assumptions I encountered helping maintain the process.nextTick shim for browserify,When does process become art? When do tools become collaborators? Let's explore the world of procedural art -- both analog and digital -- through the wall drawing of Sol LeWitt. This talk teaches how to make art in the style of LeWitt's wall drawings with CSS and JavaScript, and along the way provides some insight into the history of procedural art, the nature of randomness, and how tools and algorithms for creating art lead to new forms of collaboration.---This talk was selected for NationJS and I want to beta-test it on the BrooklynJS audience before I take it on the road.,The web has historically been a one-dimensional medium start at the top and scroll down. Unexplored capabilities in the browser let us break out of the 1D world and into the 3D universe.In this talk, we'll examine animating the SVG viewBox, giving us access to powerful three-dimensional motion effects. We'll use these techniques to provide spatial animations that are high-resolution, performant, and best of all, easily accessible to designers who don't need to learn how to program to deliver cinematic-quality animations on the web.,Turns out you can write _any_ JavaScript using only the characters `!`, `+`, ``, `]`, `(`, and `)`! I'll give an overview of how and why this works. I'll also do some small demonstrations using a JS console.Has anyone done this talk before? If so I'll think of something else!

Heck yeah! With microcontrollers becoming very inexpensive and communities growing around some of the devices, they've become even easier to work with.This interactive talk will show how you can create an interactive web app using Javascript on just a $2 device. I'll explain what an ESP8266 is, how you can run Javascript on it, and a demonstrate a live interactive web app running on the device.Outline- What's an ESP8266 — and what does it do?- What is Espruino?- Interactive live demo- How to build your own., Solving the JavaScript Problem with ElmTen minutes is not a lot of time to introduce an entire language; instead, the very least I can do is explain why I used to be completely unexcited about working on the front end, and now I find myself submitting a talk proposal to a JavaScript meeting.The "JavaScript Problem" is the  I give the following three issues- Lack of function arity in JS, which is solved by technologies like TypeScript and Flow- Lack of an enforced programming paradigm in JS, which is solved by frameworks like Angular, Ember and ReactFlow- Lack of a community consensus around the way to solve the previous two things, which results in "JavaScript fatigue" and is _sort of_ solved (but also compounded) by bundlers and transpilers like Browserify, Babel and WebpackElm is an incredible language that compiles to JavaScript for use on the client side while cleverly solving each these issues. In this talk I will demonstrate how Elm addresses them with its strong typing system, the Elm Architecture and a conscious philosophy centered around simplicity and user-friendliness. That may seem like a lot for a ten-minute presentation, but I think that small, illustrative examples will speak for themselves.I will also show you where you can go for more juicy Elm deets and how you can easily get started on your own.,,@willmanduffy saw my Twitter outline for this and asked for it to debut at BrooklynJS, so here it is!Inclusion is a Captain's Job uses the fantasy lens of Star Trek to bring a fresh perspective to a well-worn conversation. Starfleet is a technical organization that lives or dies based on its diversity, which makes it every captain's job to include even the most alien of their crew mates. While examples abound across the Trek canon, the overall thesis is consistent it's up to our leaders to create a workplace where all are welcome.Two of my favorite topics, combined! More fun than a barrel of Bolians!,About a year or two ago, I discovered Angus Croll’s wonderful If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript in the bookstore, and I became endlessly entranced. I studied music in college, and I started thinking a lot about what the equivalents would be between music and JS. A lot has changed in the JS world since Angus McAngusFace’s book came out, and maybe it’s time for a 2.0 on the intersection of art and JS, and JS as a language? What if Bach wrote promises and generators? How would Philip Glass use recursion? Let’s explore the possibilities.,Front end testing in the browser is really, really (2 really's) hard to get right. If you do it, it likely gets unmaintainable quickly (people start ignoring those intermittently failing tests), or teams just avoid 'front end testing' altogether. Building on Martin Fowler's notion of the evil that is non-deterministic tests ,I've been working on a browser-based game, Manygolf, for the past few months. Manygolf uses TypeScript](This blog post](,Submitted the same thing last month - httpsgithub.combrooklynjsbrooklynjs.github.iopull278I think it will be about making babel plugins; if that takes too long then it'll be just some inspiration why on everyone should learn to make one!,At its core, Atomic Design is a design methodology to create both simple and complex components which make up a website. I've been very interested in this design pattern after seeing it used by Warby Parker but it wasn't until hearing a really great talk on accessibility by Brian Sinclair that I realized it could also help us be better to the people using our software.By never writing custom buttons, forms or even <img> tags, we can strive for and achieve better design for everyone using our websites. The talk will be a quick review of the component based design systems and libraries out there and then a dive into how React + propTypes + Atomic Design can make everyone's life better. At the end of the talk we'll have made(in the browser) a small site using components that are accessible by default.,No seriously, it's about time. The short  is I want to rant for 10 minutes on time and how it's a BS social construct. The long  is I want to talk about the complexities of time handling in applications. This is not a talk that ends with answers but more like it ends with a checklist and a reminder to _really_ spend 3x the time you normally would have really cementing and thinking about anything related to time in your applications.,React gives you all of the tools to completely eliminate CSS from your next project. Heck, React even encourages it, favoring inline styles to CSS. But it doesn't provide a great roadmap for how this should be done.I'll explore a post-CSS world, showing you how I approach organizing and managing style objects and reusable components, how media queries like hover and focus can be performed without CSS, and how I build responsive elements using a declarative framework like React (hint I don't use media queries for that).After seeing how elegant life without CSS can be, you may want to abandon it in your next project too!,Electron! The complete NodeJS and web browser APIs, together, in the same JavaScript file! Build (almost) any desktop application you can dream of.Electron's simplicity in design benefits its authors and users greatly, but some native desktop functionality is sacrificed - like customizable drag and drop. The Neutrino in this talk is my patch (and hopefully merged PR) giving Electron developers more control over content dragged out of Electron.Why? So I could build the app I wanted to see in the world! Working title "Clip Art Y2K".,,the link on the site was directing to `,In December we came across a massive ad fraud which was cloaking the real domain of a web page using client side techniquesYou can see more about it herehttpsgithub.comfertelcloak-pubHere is a press release from when Comscore found itDuring the talk I will go through the way in which they perpetrate the fraud. How they go about doing it by overriding some of Javascript's standard built in objects and functions. How one cancan't protect against this - and why it's hard to trust someone else's windows and scripts.,…ct with Redux baked in),For a while, I wanted to be an Engineering Manager “when I grew up.” I figured I’d be good at it, but it took becoming one to really understand all that goes into it. In this talk, I’ll discuss the my transition from JavaScript Engineer to Engineering Manager, including what being an Engineering Manager entails— making sure her team is happy, healthy, communicating, growing, and, of course, getting their work done— and how it’s affected the way I interact with co-workers and other humans.Bonus points (maybe?) because this month will be the two year anniversary of my first talk, which was at BrooklynJS! ✨ ,In tandem with my EmpireJS talk — Jiro Dreams of Code What Startups Can Learn From Chef Culture — I want to dig into what developers can learn from chefs as they write recipes for those who come behind them to figure out their code documentation. My Empire talk will only graze on some of these points and so I would like to use this chance to delve a little deeper into this specific aspect of the commonalities between chefs and engineers. Feel free to shoot me an email or a slack message (i am in borojs slack as `patricia`) if you have any questions. 😁 ,Your World of Text, launched in 2009, is an interactive web art project that gets 100,000 visitors per month. The site is (realtime, infinite) wall where anonymous users can write and overwrite each other. I will talk about the history of the site and some implementation details.,Data is omnipresent in your environment. Tiny pieces assemble into a larger meaning that your mind and senses can understand. Certain chunks of data can repel people, the same data can attract others. How can you use JavaScript to transform the context into something completely different? Can it pass through several machines of distortion and back out again, a better version?In my latest art project, I take annoying audio from the NYC subway and attempt to endear others to it by hiding what it truly is, using JavaScript in the browser. I'll outline the technology used, the decisions I made on the data transformationcorruption, and most importantly, why you should be silly with code.,As web-based data visualizations are becoming more sophisticated and data sets continue to increase in size, our favorite SVG is not always the right tool for the job.In this short talk I discuss a simple technique to make SVG play nicely with Canvas and WebGL to quickly create performant interactives on the web.I give examples of how to do this using either d3.js or React, and show live examples of how sites like the New York Times have used this method.,I kind of just want a ticket to see Rich's Buble talk and Evan's Vue talk but if anyone wants to hear about Babel, 👍.I'm thinking it could either be about how Babel works, how you can contribute (always appreciated), or making your own plugin?,This will be mostly about the recently announced Vue.js 2.0, in which I will talk about templates vs. virtual DOM, why both are great for their use cases, and how combining them actually leads to some interesting low-hanging fruit in terms of performance optimization.,When does process become art? When do tools become collaborators? Let's explore the world of procedural art -- both analog and digital -- through the wall drawing of Sol LeWitt. This talk teaches how to make art in the style of LeWitt's wall drawings with CSS and JavaScript, and along the way provides some insight into the history of procedural art, the nature of randomness, and how tools and algorithms for creating art lead to new forms of collaboration.,So a couple of weeks ago I released a Babel alternative called Bublé is to generate an AST from the source code, analyse that AST, manipulate it, then generate code from it. Bublé skips the last two steps, modifying the code in place instead. This approach is _waaaay_ faster, and doesn't bork up your formatting and code style. And it's done in a way that you still get sourcemaps etc.Unless you think that's too in-the-weeds in which case there are a few other angles- ES2015 footguns- pragmatic vs ideological programming- you say NIH, I say progress- designing APIs around humans, rather than the implementationCheers!,JavaScript is a very expressive language. See how it can inspire the whole range of human emotion - wonder, fear, joy, determination... Hear about success and failure from the greats. Feel free to pin any of these to your mirror ) quotestagram js(This is a mostly humorous talk. It doesn't really have any technical information, but does encourage using code as a language for personal expression. I gave this talk earlier this month at BostonJS](,Cats love sitting in the boxes their expensive toys came in. Tasty’s Facebook page is putting Food Network to shame. Bob's Burgers is taking over TV.What makes an idea worth building? Where is the line between simple and trivial? As engineers we can do amazing things with code, but it's just a tool—for all the bells and whistles we can build, we shouldn’t forget the amazing things code allows us to do with content.At face value, the stuff mentioned above isn't that impressive…cats are just sitting in cardboard, Tasty is just telling us recipes, Bob is just a cartoon—but their _content_ makes them something different Bob's Burgers chellenges how we think about storytelling, Tasty makes cooking more accessible, cats…are cats.I want to talk about projects that aren’t all that impressive from an obvious technical standpoint, but are still really compelling because of their content. This talk will have 3 parts 1. Explore how appreciating contentconcept can help frame our feels around both our own work and stuff we encounter2. Look at some examples of ‘simple’ things that got a lot of traction, maybe a couple quotes cause who doesn’t love a good pullquote (there will be audio)3. Wrap up with a couple personal projects that follow this philosophy of simple techinteresting content,i will talk about these things. this is fairly off the cuff but mostly what i would like to say- "Your perfectly valid JS is not valid. Your code is not valid. Are you even valid?" is not a healthy question to have in your life. Linter test build failures make me feel this way. Are Trailing spaces, Spaces around infix operators, and semi colons more important than your mental health?- Linters make the development process an authoritarian relationship where conformity is painful and each individuals responsibility.- I thrive in spaces that promote creativity and as a human my primary skill is inconsistency. If we use robots to find creative syntax we should let the robot change it instead of telling us we are wrong. Lets use tools that are tools not overlords.- Switching out eslint with esformatter. standard-format.  more work we need to do.- Help me get rid of every linter in your life.,myEyeSelfie is an arttech project we take a macro photo of a person's eye, upload it to myeyeselfie.com and my javascript code processes and analyzes the image, using Hough algorithm finds and crops out the iris (which later on is projected onto a dome httpswww.instagram.commyeyeselfie),While the rise of spaces like the Recurse Center is promising, much of my profession still doesn't do a particularly good job at teaching our skills to others.  As I move from being a journey-level developer to mentoring others, I've recently been reflecting on how I learned what I've learned. I'd like to talk about these three tools that helped me figure out how to code, become a software engineer, and now learn to teach what I've mastered.,When it comes to team process there are a million variations of Agile, Scrum, Lean, etc. that engineering teams use to be productive and build good products. But no matter what process your team uses, how can _you_ be the best dev you can be? By collaborating, of course! In this talk, we'll go over some ways to apply engineering skills to collaborate better with designers and product people on your team.,I head up "frontend ops", if there is such a thing, along with the frontend architectural decisions and implementation on the Hillary Clinton Campaign at our HQ in Brooklyn Heights. We use all the typical hipster bells and whistles such as React, Immutable, Flux, Isomorphic JS, Webpack, ESNext, etc...and I'd like to speak about how our build has evolved to be flexible in this rapidly changing ecosystem. Our build repo is open source and on my github httpsgithub.comdtothefpbuild-boilertreemasterpackages,Use JavaScript to create and visualize a simple model for predicting the fastest growing and biggest programming languagesframeworks (using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey). ,Three approaches to D3.js and React.js their pros, cons, and use cases.  Slides here](,When available syntax and paradigms don't cut the mustard, web developers like to turn to new technology. Javascript not doing it for you? Try Coffeescript. CSS not working out? Try SASS.  But over time, people gravitate towards solutions which allow them to write code using syntax that will work natively in the future.  Why use Coffeescript when you've got ES6?! Why use SASS when you've got PostCSS+CSSNext?!For the view, when concatenating a string doesn't work out, we rely on templating engines like Handlebars and Nunjucks, or on more recent approaches like React's JSX.  But do you expect browsers to have native support for these technologies?  The solution?! httpsgithub.commaxogdenyo-yo! Combining ES6 Template Literals and intelligent DOM diffing, yo-yo uses syntax and language features that are already supported in some modern browsers, and with its 4kb footprint is easy to include client-side!  In addition to explaining some of the library's features, I'll be demoing a small ToDo example to illustrate how easy it is to get started with `yo-yo`!yo yes](,Pokémon celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, so why not take some time off from getting fatigued over JavaScript to relax with one of the world's most popular games. Every developer starts their journey with a single framework, like the protagonist of Red and Blue started out with their first companion. But the path to becoming a champion involves exploring new frontiers, meeting new people, and learning that no option comes without weaknesses. Have you mastered 150+ JavaScript modules? There's lots to learn from Pokemon for those new and old to the series.!,So I launched mostbeautiful.horse a couple weeks ago from my phone while hanging out at a friends place and losing at Magic the Gathering.

Maybe some people will be more creative than just an image and a link!,We'd like to introduce our open sourced fully responsive video recorder and player.,I love the explanatory power of gifs, and lately I've been chasing the notion of how to best write JS animations and automatically turn them into gifs without screen capture. I've worked through at least 10 different approaches to this, ranging from slightly convoluted to completely insane, mostly summarized herehttpsgithub.comveltmananimation-testsMy talk would set up the problem and go through some of these ideas and the tradeoffs of each one, plus the "what-ifs" that are still on my mind and how these techniques can be put towards making videos with JavaScript.,_How to Print Your Own ASCII Art Selfies_Everyone loves selfies and ASCII art. In this talk I will live code a simple Node.js app that will allow the audience to send a selfie via MMS and have it printed in ASCII art with a thermal receipt printer. The printer has bluetooth capabilities and is the same device that the meter maids in NYC use.,I was hoping to give a talk about a project I'm working on -- webcoder -- which allows you to edit code remotely in a browser (github.commjlyonswebcoder, screenshot attached). Unlike Sublime, Atom, etc., which assume the editor runs on the same computer as the code, webcoder lets you work from any computer's web browser regardless of where the code livesruns on. So you could store and run your code on a a Digital Ocean instance and and edit the code from any computer that can run a web browser. It's certainly not as full featured as pretty much any other code editor, but it does syntax highlighting for a bunch of languages (including JS), has a folder navigator, and Ctrl-P fast file search. It's good enough that I use it for my day job, and it's written in ES6 with React for the client and Express for the server.Thanks,Mike,What's in a ? The story of Mullet.io neckbeard This is the story of mullet.io and many other open-source projects designed and d purely for learning and a few laughs.

Nearly every single electronic instrument (and many other weird creations) since then speak it....and for some inexplicable reason your browser does too...So let's take this poster-child for browser bloat and build some cool stuff with it!We'll use this simple, yet powerful protocol to explore the history of electronic music, all while building an arpeggiator (in the browser!) that talks to a real physical synthesizer.Let's make some javascript music together!(will require audio, I can route the synthesizer audio to my laptop, or we should be able to use the external speaker mentioned in the FAQ),In introducing people to our FluxReact architecture, I have found that the most challenging part of learning Flux is understanding Reactive programming.  Luckily, long ago 0] I read The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs and realized that reactive programming is very much like the rules to a certain card game 1].  I will explain how reactive programming is like Magic 2] by walking through some code where everything has been red to fit 3] this metaphor.  In the process I hopefully will clarifying why reactive programming is a great fit for JavaScript and make it easier for people to pick up reactive tools from Flux to RxJS and beyond.0] We can say that about the 90s now, right?1] Or at least, the version of that card game we played in the 90s.2] "Magic" like the game, not "magic" like Rails.3] "Fit" may be an overstatement.

I plan on mostly combining ideas from this blog post](,I've given a similar talk at Nodevember, but I'm going to distill the passionate part and excise the tech deep dive from it.,I've spent the past two years studying social media algorithms, harassment, and online communities. I created a performance art piece called "Social Media Break Up Coordinator" where I give users advice about their social media practices. I'm part life coach, part SEO specialists. But the advice is all algorithmically driven. Users fill out a 21 point quiz, and depending upon what they say, I give them specific, automated responses. This project is also a way for me to collect data around how people use social media, and how connected people are to the privacy policies of social media. I was really interested in seeing what people would say and if they would pay me to be an emotional mechanical turk. The project is also inspired by the sharing economy with the wondering of should we outsource certain things, and emotional hardships to someone, and can we automate that? It's incredibly hard to automate emotion with an algorithm, but it's a lot easier to intervene as a human. This project fits in-between those spaces- part human, and part algorithm, but all designed to fit into the spaces where social media breaks down and falls us, and a new person or thing can step in and help mitigate- be it a work problem, family, friendship or romantic.,We'll introduce our open source framework that we have used to build Ziggeo.- Package management system that allows to play nicely with other frameworks- Package management system that compiles only used modules into the final distributable- Performant, extensible view engine- Data synchronization layer ,For the March MeetupDifferent parts of our brain are accessed by different activities.

I believe the answer is code that expressively employs the power of architecture to clearly communicate with the reader, leaving minimal room for confusion or misunderstanding.  What is beautiful in C will be different than what is beautiful in Smalltalk, and both will be different than beautiful Haskell code.Often the language itself imposes the paradigm, but Javascript is so easy-going we have to decide for ourselves what type of code we want to create.  Despite the extra work this makes for us, it also allows for innovations that would go against the grain in any other language.  We can write code that is beautiful the way functional code is beautiful, or code that is beautiful the way object-oriented code is beautiful, but it also leaves the door open to novel forms.One such new approach is Flux, an architecture pattern that emerged from Facebook.  It is an example of reactive programming, and it can be a mind twist for people used to object-oriented or functional paradigms.  Unfortunately the documentation is expansive and at times obtuse, diving quickly into the weeds.  I offer instead a high-level explanation, involving fewer justifications and more pictures to demonstrate how Flux fits the ways JavaScript itself is structured, and how it supports writing beautiful JavaScript code., you don't know npm> a talk to take you beyond `npm install`- github => httpsgithub.comashleygwilliamsyou-dont-know-npm- slides => ,There's a great deal of excitement around service workers, thanks to the speed and offline-first benefits they promise.

Drawing inspiration from the writing manual 'Elements of Style', the audience will find a recurring motif in the quote 'omit needless words'. Topics will include linting, es6 features, react+redux, and unit testing. Though these topics may seem broad, we'll outline a unified approach to modern web development.,I'd like to offer a  talk on the Single Responsibility Principle and JavaScript. I would introduce the SRP and why it makes application easier to understand and maintain. And then go over some ways of approaching it when writing OO JS and Functional JS.,This talk is an intro to mechanical keyboards for people who type for a living.I will introduce the vocabulary around mechanical keyboards (and keyboards ingeneral), the options available to the professional typist, and theconsiderations in choosing your typing technology.

I’d like to go through the tech I’ve used and the challenges I faced both in hardware and software, and how your personal project can be a great learning tool, and a lot of fun.,In this talk I'll describe the super-secret ideas that went into implementing ProseMirror,,As a beginner using git, you're often told that amending commits should only be done locally, and that you should never, ever, ever force push. However, a lot of open source repositories on GitHub use a system for pull requests where you are _expected_ to amend commits and force push. In this talk, I'd like to talk about what they mean by this, and I want to talk about your options for updating a pull request when a repository maintainer asks you to. My talk is aimed at both beginners who have opened their first PR with a spelling error, and at maintainers who may not be aware that asking people to update their PR can be confusing. A full post about what I want to cover can also be found here. ,I'd like to give a talk about CoffeeScript. Since the solidification of ES6 and the introduction of Babel, a lot of JS developers have started looking down on CoffeeScript, somewhat unfairly. I'd like to explain why CoffeeScript is still viable; what advantages and disadvantages the language has; and how we use CoffeeScript in production at OkCupid to mitigate the disadvantages and reap the advantages.Let me know if you need any other information, or if you have any feedback.

It's a web-based live programming IDE.  The user writes code that draws to a canvas element.  They can pause execution of their program and step forwards and backwards through the code to help them fix bugs.I'd like to do a quick demo, then talk at a high level about how the code works.  I'll talk about- How I wrote the runtime that compiles the user's code to bytecode and runs it on the VM.- How the runtime supports stepping forwards and backwards through the code. - How I wrote the parser and runtime to produce very specific, jargon-free, context-aware error messages.- How I designed the programming language to avoid some of the pitfalls of JS.Code Lauren is deployed at Thanks!,I’d like to talk about building cross-platform desktop apps with Electron, React, Flux, and Node.

Lets try to use web patterns to program missile launchers.The hardware is for fun, I'll add some features to the launcher with the 3 patterns and hopefully something will click if you don't really know how to use any of these patterns or hardware.,,- I guess this makes it Mr. Hyde?,For a developer who’s constantly thinking about how to build the best UIs for users, I recently came to the conclusion that my own workflow’s UI(UX?) is disturbingly dysfunctional, especially when I’m researching and referencing. Every time I start a new project, I find myself drowning in tabs of Stack Overflow answers, blog posts, source code, search results, and YouTube tutorials.I started wondering if we’re doing documentation completely wrong, especially in the JS world—trying to keep up with the now yearly new ES standards and proposals, and the Cambrian explosion of new frameworks released and old libraries updated (and the variations in how APIs are documented). Maybe it’s time to rethink how we design documentation, and how that fits into our workflow. Can we make one UI to rule them all? Or, are we doomed to ⌘F’ing and scrolling through inscrutable API references forever? ,This talk is about how to use progressive enhancement to craft accessible, well-structured, and device agnostic code. As a junior developer, I found the world of endless JS frameworks intimidating and chaotic, with battles being waged between evangelists on Twitter. Using progressive enhancement creates a more Zen experience by keeping your codebase simpler and easier to reason about. In a world where new frameworks, libraries, and architecture styles are going in and out of fashion with the seasons, everyone could use a little more Zen.,Ember 2.0 introduces a brand new component system that emphasizes a data down, actions up] architecture that makes reasoning about your app's UI a breeze. This talk will introduce the concepts of Glimmer Components, how to use them in an Ember app, and how they fit into your app's overall app architecture.,… ExtensionThis is the story of building Beagle. Instead of going through and answering these questions directly, I'll retell what I tried, what worked, and what didn't. ,A lot of people are spooked out and frightened by the built-in node debugger.  They shouldn't be!  A live-exercise in debugging via the console for your node applications!,This is likely going to be hard to do in 10 minutes, but I want to touch on Operational Transform and Differential Sync which are both strategies for keeping mutated state synced across multiple clients (like how google docs or, well, scripto! works),,I’d like to talk about the Bookshelf ORM, and share the experience I had using it on a recent side project (,My idea is to start with the most basic of a webpack config to get it compiling and then going from there adding loaders and hot swapping and more.  Explaining the config properties as we go along.,Flux and Redux are interesting variants on a pattern for application state handling, but the jargon for talking about these patterns can verge on Seussian. I'll be using pictures to explain what they really mean.I'm planning slides similar to- - ,I want to share some culture secrets I've learned that will help people on the daily and the big picture stuff. It's the serious business of being silly. ,By unpopular demand, I'd like to propose a talk about how using Vim can make you more efficient at Javascript, after making you way less efficient. But it's worth it. Vim makes you think modularly, and applies it to your every move in editing, which helps you write better code. I'd also like to talk about how you can customize Vim for Javascript.,Feedback and edits welcome!,Making crazy effects with GLSL shaders that work on the web, and on your phone.,…derbrush,First everyone just nested callbacks until they got sick of side-scrolling. Then came the promise of a better way, but that has its own chain of problems.

Many of these systems also use Node.js as the mechanism for writing web hooks.This talk will explore this idea in general and what it means for how we develop web systems going forward – and will also introduce LambCI – a continuous integration system built on AWS Lambda (and AWS ECS) – to the wider world (you heard it here first folks!),Chrome code snippets are powerful and under appreciated feature. Small code snippets are stored in the local storage, with full syntax highlighting and convenient editing. They can be executed in the context of the page, allowing one to easily profile, rewrite and hack the application. The code snippets are like bookmarklets on steroids! Here is a repo with lots of them httpsgithub.combahmutovcode-snippets and a blog post describing using them Bonus the code snippets can update themselves from a remote server, like github. Sick!,The common pattern of syncing our UI with the database is through Ajax  XHR requests (or even full page refreshes) and reflecting the response once it's received.But what if we didn't have to rely so heavily on that response? How do we reliably update the front-end as quickly as possible without asking the server first?The same resources and patterns that are used in offline-first apps can be used for these "optimistic updates".In this talk, I'll discuss how the idea works, the ideal and not-so-ideal use cases for this pattern, and what tooling is available to help us become Optimist Primes today. ,I'd like to present a demo of Semantic UI and discuss how thinking in terms of Frederic Brook's principles of "progressive truthfulness,What does it mean to write functional code versus object oriented code in js? Is there another "way" to write js code (or any code)?

Are there libraries you use everyday, whose boilerplate you dream of hiding away once and for all? Clearly the right answer is to create your own domain-specific language that compiles to JS, a personal Babel if you will, all in your own spare time.No, wait, come back! In this talk I will cover the outlines of creating your own language, including PEGs (parsing expression grammars), the path code takes from the lexer to behavior, and tools attendees can use to create their own works, in particular PLTJS (and, permission pending, a new, not-quite-released tool).I will also discuss the process around the development of Data Monster, my domain-specific language that compiles to d3.js and is hosted in Javascript.,I'd like to discuss a few techniques, tools, and guiding principles for improving technical documentation for software projects, because THEY ALL CONFUSE THE HELL OUT OF ME but I don't think it's just because I am an idiot!?,I want to talk a bit about the JavaScript Bridge, an iOS tool to run native code through JavaScript.  In the last two versions of iOS (8 and 9), Apple has been giving more power to JavaScript. I think I can find 9 other things that are interesting to go along with it.,Modifications and updates to HTML to indicate Paul Ford appearance at BrooklynJS. Comments welcome.,Hey folks. I've been working on a new project called Rollup But only if we start embracing ES6 modules soon.So I'd love to talk about what the project does, how it works, and how people can help drive AMD and CommonJS into the past where they belong.Just to prove that this isn't totally pie-in-the-sky, the next version of D3 is built with ES6 modules and bundled with Rollup. Some of the famous D3 examples can be made roughly 95% smaller as a result!,Would love to share more about the platform! ,,I've added my  & proposed topic .,I've been spending the past year getting really into learning human languages. Before that, it was years and years learning programming languages. While I still break away to read the ES2015 or Java 8 blog post frequently, most of my non-work time has been spent trying to learn Spanish, French and German. I'd like to talk to you about the odd parallels that I've found between learning human, natural languages and learning programming languages.,in which i talk about using technology to make art-- specifically, an exquisite corpse](,An introduction to the Chrome Extensions APIs, a few extensions we've built @ Genius, and how people can get started making their own today.,You spend disproportionately more time _reading_ code than writing it. So why not make it easy for ourselves and others to understand what we have written? _Refactoring_ is your friend that can help immensely. The discipline of refactoring can make programming a joy and help breakdown complex looking problems into simpler parts. In this talk we will take a _fast-paced tour_ of various strategies and techniques to simplify your JavaScript code. We will also look at refactoring AngularJS code.Let’s all make the leap from good-code to great-highly-readable-code!,Before I head off to Oakland, I'd like to share some things I've learned drawing geometric figures in JavaScript. While this introduction can't be guaranteed to align your chakras, unlock the secrets of the pyramids or provide admission to the Illuminati, there may well be mention of the golden section, ten-fold symmetry and other such mathematical marvels.E.g.Building a dodecagon with a ruler and compasses](Plotting a rose with pentagonal spirals](,Hey, I applied last month, but had to bail cause of reasons...

Forms should be, in most cases, derived from data, whether that is a model with empty attributes for a POST or with pre-set attributes for a PUT.  From there React can take over and render the form, validate, display errors and finally submit. Extra bonus(or extra points off?!?) Will try to get a view helper for Rails written to allow this to be rendered server-side.,So you want to open source that library? There are dozens of "open source" licenses, how do you pick one? What do they all mean? A practical and opinionated guide for people who want to share their code, and maybe already are.

I'd like to talk here about the nitty gritty of moving a codebase from "not-react", Backbone perhaps, to React in an incremental way. In doing so, I'll also introduce some strong points of React(hint, it isn't the diffing and some parts are non-technical, even) surrounding that provide compelling reasons for a business to consider an incremental migration.,@brianloveswords you made me do thisThere have been a fair amount of talks on hardware already I'm guessing (oh hai I'm new to this meetup), but I wanted to provide a slightly different angle, which is writing libraries for hardware rather than just using them. There are a lot of head-scratching moments when you begin, so a high level guide with some tibits to get the audience started on bare-metal bits and bytes via Javascript would be my aim. Presented in a highly entertaining, non-dry format of course.,Never got around to learning AppleScript for interface automation on your Mac? That's ok, because Javascript has broken out of the DOM and into your native applications! I'll show you the key API's and make a simple script.,At Shapeways we created a library, ShapeJS, to help developers use javascript to create 3d printable models. In just a few lines of code you can modify existing 3d model files, turn 2d images into 3d models, or even just use simply shapes and boolean operations to create 3d models from scratch (see example scripts This talk will cover the basics of getting started with ShapeJS and how to create a simple client side web app to create customizable 3d models.,A quick primer on using Firebase to build rich web application not only capable of storing and retrieving data, but also propagate data updates in real-time.  Will live-code a real-time chat web app without a custom backend.,I love D3. I've used it lots. However, if I'm making a complex interactive visualization, my D3 code turns to soup.

Plus, I'll probs change it to make it less serious and more fun.  Because BrooklynJS is fun.,If you're a good developer, there's probably a little voice in your head that says "this code I'm writing could be more efficient, more elegant, less bug-prone."This is a great instinct if you're developing applications and tools. But it can hinder you if you're trying to do creative coding. I'm going to talk about when and where "bad" coding practices can help you. I'll use plenty of examples from coding my various JS-based creative projects](,Before I added a "dumb queue" process to TodaysMeet, every deploy managed to result in _someone_ seeing an error message.

So this talk is about those tricks.,If you've worked for a great manager, or a lousy one, you know what a difference a manager can make.  If you're an emerging manager, maybe you've been leading a team for several weeks -- or for several years.  By now, you've seen that managing is its own distinct discipline, and craft.  We'll talk about management's foundational skills, and how you can gain and refine your expertise through practice, persistence, and the power of mentorship.,Hi. I would like to do a quick demo of making a sparkly 3D particle system in Javscript using three.js. ,Must avoid the hair.,While most of us love building apps in JavaScript, we'd also love it if people used them, and if we're lucky, _lots_ of people. Problem is, then we really need to care about about how our app runs and scales, and it's best to think about that before that moment of fame arrives.I'll show a few tools and services that can help you manage your infrastructure, and the proscons of different approaches, so spend more time building your apps, and less dealing with keeping your app running.Some of the toolsplatforms I'll be discussing are Heroku](,holding a spot...,The journey of a CSS developer through the world of d3. ,A talk about how ASI works, the debate around it, and how I built a tool that enables effortless switching between the styles.,``` jsalert(spoiler);  "Writing JS with Asian characters only."```,It is so often that designers, developers, and other members of the community focus on the technical skills and tools that allow us to do our jobs in the best way possible, but, in the wake of the hype, we lose track of our greatest assets as humans, empathy. Each time we take to social media because latest pop culture change] happened and we grab our digital pitchforks to take down the beasts that caused this outrage. What can we do in the community to alleviate this plague of snap judgement and make us better people?

Open source project failures through contributor fallout. Bullying that leads to the bullying of bullies.How do we maintain our communities? How do we grow them? How is anyone in their right mind stepping into the caustic social media environment of programming we have created for ourselves?There are steps we can take with user groups, conferences, online worlds that can help support an inclusive environment that allows for debate, learning, growing, and excitement. The social sciences have 100 years of research that can provide us with tools to treat our fellow programmers with care. Much of this has been battle-tested in the organizations we run. The bubbles we live in. I'll share how we're creating a better world that is welcoming to programmers, new and experienced, so that we're leading by example. Oh and try not to soapbox because that's gross.Your words are powerful, and “actions speak louder than words, but not nearly as often.”,My excellent colleague @gscottolson has proposed httpsgithub.combrooklynjsbrooklynjs.github.iopull95 to talk about building the front-end of mix.fiftythree.com with React.I'd love to also talk about our focused effort shipping the back-end, built on Node — in particular, how we dug into some performance issues and made it fast. Some very interesting discoveries and lessons learned. (E.g. around event loop blocking, and how significant that is given single-threaded-ness.)It'll also be fun to share a bit about the tools and frameworks we've built on, e.g. Streamline.js.,The web team at FiftyThree has spent the better part of two years working on Mix by FiftyThree.

I want to share some of the challenges and benefits of building a large-scale web app using React components.,code in node, package in node-webkit to make desktop app.,Prototyping and building MVPs with simple, monolithic apps is great you can use a single framework, they're easy to install and run and test. Service-oriented architectures are a lot more robust for mature applications. I used Node—and a bunch of other tools—to help todaysmeet.com from a big monolith to a collection of smaller, focused apps as it grew naturally.Anyway I think it's super interesting, and I'd like to talk about how small teams and projects can evolve naturally into mature, SOA projects, instead of trying to make all sorts of crazy optimizations and assumptions from day zero.,The ncolorpalette is a single page that applies a new, limited palette to a full-color image.

We don't just shave yaks anymore, we spend time designing more elaborate yak-shaving equipment. Other craftspeople (chefs, painters, carpenters, whatever) are expected to maintain their own tools, but we programmers have become disconnected from our own work.- We don't spend enough time talking about developer user experience. We _obsess_ over pixel-level details as far as end users are concerned, but don't apply the same level of attention when we're building things for other developers.This talk is part sales pitch (I'm working on a new build tool called Gobble, part rant about the state of software development in 2014, and part call to arms.,Because I'm annoying,Would love to talk about my sax based html->markdown converter and why sometimes sax-based HTML parsing is for the win!,Avoid npm in production by packaging apps as tarballs using Docker (aka.

For some time I have been thinking of how I could share my healing process with the JS community. Brian's talk at JSConf this year provided me with new ideas and I finally came up with one at the airport today. I may want to share this talk at a larger conference, but I'd like a test run at a local meetup first. I'd like the honor of presenting it at BKJS thanks to the inspiration provided by Brian's powerful speech. This talk will use javascript and data structure analogies to describe the strategies I use for healing the difficult problems we face in life. I understand if this doesn't fit the meetup format. ,This is a talk about something I have to constantly remind myself and others. Often times we hit a wall and get stuck on a problem, only to realize much later and after lengthy and unnecessary pain the solution was simple _if we just reframed the problem as something else_.This talk is inspired by, and talks about, one of my favorite "Ah-ha!" moments when getting my degree in CompSci, and that was learning to write a solver for the eight-puzzle (or sliding puzzle). When looked at concretely I thought we would spend all this time writing formulas and deriving some sort of mathematical solution. Instead our AI professor said "If you see the placement of the pieces as a Vertex and a move as an Edge, you've reframed and reduced the problem to something already solved finding the shortest path between two Vertexes.,So Jennscript's talk at EmpireJS inspired me to give a talk on a more serious Computer Science topic that actually turns out to be super useful and interesting. I had actually forgotten this fact until I retook Algorithm Analysis as the last part of my Masters degree this semester at Columbia.I will quickly try to cover- Ok, seriously, what? Well G = (V,E) not G = lines and dots- Dijkstra's algorithm and shortest paths- Minimum spanning trees _(maybe)_- I got mad flow (networks) -- Ford-Fulkerson etc. - A wild application or two.Seriously though graphs are like everything.

P ≠ NP and whatnot.,Would love to talk about my sax based html to markdown converter Dr Sax (,Basically, I was structuring my SCSS files poorly; using an ID for each AngularJS partial. Because of this, I felt like I wanted to use a directive instead of using inline logic to switch IDs when I needed dynamic styling. So, I spent some time looking at ngClass, and hacked together ngId. Here, I'll talk about my process and how I did everything backwards, and how, in general, to think about submitting to open source projects.,Promises, everybody's favorite way of sanely managing asynchronous code, have recently landed native implementations in Chrome and Firefox. I'll talk about what they are and why they're great, and how you can avoid ever having rightward drift like this```   foo(function(){     bar(function(){       baz(function(){         quux(function(){           console.log('help me');         });       });     });   });```I'll talk about what the native implementations bring to the table, and summarize some of the popular promises libraries already out there.,I'd like to talk to you about WebRTC DataChannels, in the form of interpretive arm flaps.Basically I'd be covering what's discussed in this blog post](,I'd love to show off my sax-based html to markdown converter dr. sax](,The skiplist](,I'd like to talk about Marionette Behaviors. If you're a backbone developer and haven't heard of Behaviors before, they'll blow your mind. In a nutshell, behaviors are Marionette's response to view Mixins like cocktail, but without the headache associated with mixin property clobbering. People are creating Behaviors for everything from tooltips to form validation. In the talk I'll show how you could build an RSS reader with Behaviors and touch on some of the principles behind Behaviors.I'm a core-contributor to Marionette and one of the engineers who built Behaviors. We've been using Behaviors at Etsy for the past month.,It's not functional reactive 3D transformational monads, it's testing. Because people should write tests for their JavaScript. Because it's cool.,Technical writing is a soooper important skill for developers that's often overlooked. Even if you're not writing books or blog posts, your ability to provide clear instructionsdocumentation on your program is imperative if you want anybody to bother using the thing. We'll take a look at the current resources available for improving technical writing (or lack thereof), figure out what makes for readable & understandable writing on complex topics and maybe compare some examples and stuff. Mkay?,Linguistic relativity, or the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, states that the language(s) you speak affect the way you think. I want to talk about if this applies to programming languages as well, (spoiler alert!) how it does, and the ways in which it's a little different because programming languages are just a little different than programming languages.,Talk about Uncle Bob Martin's SOLID principles and how they apply to JavaScript. The SOLID concept came about during the day's where static Object Oriented languages reigned supreme. Do these principles apply to JS, A dynamic language that not only supports an Object Oriented style but Functional as well?,Sketch](,Total and shameful duplicate of 50. As requested by @brianloveswords +1 ,How to make a binary executable that doesn't have the "install node.js" pre-requisite.

I also read my calendar correctly this time and will be in Brooklyn the 17th.If you really hate surprises, checkout httpsgithub.comimlucaslone,A talk about how WebRTC and other hot HTML5 technologies are used to create cooperative animated gifs, on ,This is your life as a Javascript developer. You look at metadata all day long. You make decisions on it. Which package is right for me? If it has the most dependents or Github stars that means it is good, right? Play this game enough times and you learn there is more to choice than metadata. There is code. I've been conducting some research on static analysis visualization and indexing. The focus of this talk will be how to get the static analysis data with esprima (and maybe Manta for public npm packages) and how to search ASTs for a few meaningful patterns.,Docker is the newest kid on the block regarding deployments. Previous meetups introduced the borough people to Docker itself.However that's not all. Coupled with nodejs you can do pretty cool stuff, like launch multiple versions of your website at the same time in order to figure out when a visual bug was introduced.I've been working on making that super simple with spinup.I will talk about that and other projects in addition to ideas that are now implementable to hopefully get more people on board with the dockernodejs love affair.

Its ecosystem contains everything you need to create scalable architectures powering large single page applications.Its modularity also can let you implement pieces to refactor spaghetti code bases without embarking on The Big Rewrite.Backbone's very unopinionated, so it can be dangerous and overwhelming to go alone. We'll discuss patterns for creating Single Page Applications, as well as strategies for rescuing legacy applications.,Resubmitting from last month as requestedTips and best practices for helping make OSS better, including- Writing test cases- Fixingimproving documentation- Tricks for Node.jsnpm module bug fixing,> both are true stories that happened around the same time.- "You should just use go!"- wanted node-webkit, but without the extra 50mb of webkit... few existing attempts were one-offs- whipped up a little code for building standalone binaries called lone.js- need help getting binary add-ons to work right- swedish meatballs were enjoyed by all timeline- thurs project change.

And other benefits. (Basically good for if you are writing Command Line Utilities or server scripting in Node.),This talk will cover what I learned while experimenting with a relatively simple multithreaded game engine. Topics include- interpolated rendering, allowing 60fps independent of game updates- using webworkify to make web workers easier to... work... with...- a 11 comparison of the same code running in single threaded mode- ASCII art headings and diagrams- an excellent way to lock up your browser in the pursuit of SPEEDThe talk assumes people have knowledge of JS topics like rAF, setTimeout, postMessage, etc. but no specific game programming experience.,AngularJS E2E testing with protractor. Protractor is a node testing framework for AngularJS applications built on top of webdriver js. I will give a quick overview to get you started.The presentation will be a shorter version of a tech talk I gave at Google httpsgithub.comandresdomingueztesting-tech-talk,I will talk about how I approached building a Spider Solitaire game. I will walk through the process I went through in building the game - how I thought it may work, how I pulled everything together, and challenges I ran into along the way.,This talk propsoal is time-sensitive because, c'mon, who will remember FlapMMO](,Javascript is an extremely flexible language that loses some of its power when shoe-horned into a classical OOP mindset. While sometimes inheritance works in your favor (see Backbone.Marionette), I propose to remind ourselves to take advantage of dynamic context and use more composition in our objects.This talk will relate experiences from a recently completed SPA project built on Backbone.Marionette. It will specifically use Backbone-based code as an example, but not specifically be about Backbone.,Tips and best practices for helping make OSS better, including- Writing test cases- Fixingimproving documentation- Tricks for Node.jsnpm module bug fixing,This is part of a talk I'll be co-presenting at Fluentconf in March.> explore Accessibility Developer Tools, an open source library which allows developers to run a suite of accessibility checks on their webpage as part of automated testing.

If I had more time I'll present more demos, like runtime analysis, heat maps etc.,Am resubmitting a proposal from last month (13), partly because @brianloveswords said I should, and partly because submitting a talk seems like the best way to get a ticket...Having seen the talks on Wednesday though I'm revising the proposal to make it a better fit for the format - more conceptual and focused. The concept is that throwing HTML at the browser is no longer the best way to build web apps - that worked for static documents, and it kind of worked for apps that make heavy use of client-side string-based templating (e.g. Handlebars), but for a lot of modern apps we need something smarter.Hence the idea of a UI library (Ractive.js](,- Mary Rose Cook- I'll explain the code for a simple Lisp interpreter in JavaScript.  I'll talk through the code that takes the string of raw Lisp code and parses it into a tree structure.  I'll talk through the code that walks through the tree structure and executes it.  The talk is ten minutes long.  Though we'll move fast, no prior knowledge of Lisp or interpreters is required.Thanks!, ProblemWe sold out 90 tickets in ~45 minutes this time. We should find a better way to mete out tickets.
